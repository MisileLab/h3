    <h3>Broken Authentication</h3>
    <div class="box">

        <h4>What is Broken Authentication</h4>
            <p class="bp">Broken authentication is an umbrella term for several vulnerabilities that attackers exploit to impersonate legitimate users online. Broadly, broken authentication refers to weaknesses in two areas: session management and credential management. Both are classified as broken authentication because attackers can use either avenue to masquerade as a user: hijacked session IDs or stolen login credentials.

Attackers employ a wide variety of strategies to take advantage of these weaknesses, ranging from huge credential stuffing attacks to highly targeted schemes aimed at gaining access to a specific personâ€™s credentials.

        <button class="coll btn btn-info">Lab Details</button>
        <div class="lab">
              <p class="bp">


                  <p class="bp">
                        The lab consists of a login page, which request users for name and password.
                      If you arent aware of the password ,there is also a feature for login with otp!
                      When the users clicks the <i>login with otp</i> feature. User is directed to a page, which asks users email id to send the otp.
                      When the user provides an email id , you can see that the 3 digit opt is sent back to the page itself.
                      This is not the general scenario , usually the code is sent to the registered email of the user.
                     <br>The user on receiving the 3 digit code can now enter the code in the input box that says <i>Enter your OTP</i>
                      On entering the valid OTP the user gets a page which says <i>Login Success as:::user email</i> .
                       If the Otp is wrong then the user gets a message saying <i>Invalid OTP</i>
                  </p>


                  <b>The Bug</b>

                  <p class="bp">
                     The main aim of this lab is to login as admin, for that you are gonna exploit the lack of <i>rate limiting</i> feature in the otp verification flow.
                     You can see that the otp is only of 3 digit(for demo purposes) and the application doesnt have any <i>captcha</i> or restricts number of tries for the otp.
                   </p>

                  <p class="bp">Now to send the otp to admins mail you need to figure out the admins mail id.
                  Luckily the admin has left his email id for the developers in the page source.
                  Admins email id <i>admin@pygoat.com</i>
                  Enter this email in the send otp input box and hit send,you can see that the page says that otp is sent to the email id of the admin.
                  In order to exploit the lack of rate limiting , we can try to <i>Brute-force</i> the 3 digit otp.
                  </p>

                  <p class="bp">
                      Steps to Brute force:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Open Burpsuite and configure your browser to intercept the web trafic, but dont turn intercept on.</li>
                    <li>Send the otp to the admins mail id with the help of send otp feature.</li>
                    <li>In the enter the otp box enter a random 3 digit number.</li>
                    <li>Before your press login , turn intercept on on Burp suite and then press log in</li>
                    <li>Now you can see that the traffic is captured in Burpsuite.</li>
                    <li>Now use the send to intruder feature and send this request to the intruder.</li>
                    <li>Set the position of the payload to the <i>otp=</i> parameter.</li>
                    <li>Go to the payloads session and choose the payload type to number list</li>
                    <li> Fill the range to 100 to 999 with step 1.</li>
                    <li>Now click attack and you can see that the burp suite tries different combinations of otp and collects it response.</li>
                    <li>You can figure out if it has guessed the correct opt by seeing the difference in length of the response for each request.</li>
                    <li>The correct otp will have a small response length .</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>

                 <p class="bp">Using this otp you will be able to login into admins account.</p>

        <br><h4>Mitigation</h4>
             <p class="bp">
            This type of authentication flaw can be mitigated by:
            <ul>
            <li>Using captcha</li>
            <li>Rate Limiting by reducing the number of tries for a particular user, based on session or ip</li>
            <li>Blocking multiple request form the same IP</li>
        </ul></p>
