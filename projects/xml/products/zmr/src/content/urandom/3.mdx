## Static build powered by static-web-server

Static-web-server is rust static web server\
[Github link of that project](https://github.com/static-web-server/static-web-server)

## I also made SatelliteJS

SatelliteJS is utility of controlling dom\
Purpose is just add NullPointerException on selecting dom element\
You can use it, but I don't recommend

## AstroJS is rly good

I'm really liking AstroJS, even without island\
Server-Side and static build is awesome
