tldr: "tor-friendly, with privacy"

Every blog exists on the internet, do same theme, has many tracker or ads (or both), I doesn't want the blog like that.\
This blog differently build at three points.

## tor-friendly blog

Every blog shows captcha for tor, but i'm thinking block tor isn't good idea for privacy.\
This blog has no captcha, and has onion domain.

## no tracker or ads

Many person's blog has multiple tracker.\
My blog has no, really no ads or tracker forever, I'll promise

## different theme

I like catppuccin-mocha :sunglasses:

## is it open-source?
