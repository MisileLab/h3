## A small change on footer

You can find small change on footer, the subscribe thing.\
It's powered by listmonk and my nixos+docker, amazon ses

## But why?

Idk\
<button class="w-fit border-solid border-2 border-ctp-overlay1" id="toggleOpen">Bruh is it end? (this is button btw)</button>
<div id="realcontent" class="gap-y-4 flex flex-col" style="display: none;">
  Actually not, I just want to use nanostores and astrojs to flex my astro blog
  other blog cant this, because it's not ssr and astrojs :sunglasses:
  ## ok, but real why?
  I want to get reaction for my blog, but it isn't have tracker.
