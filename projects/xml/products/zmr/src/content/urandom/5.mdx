title: How to improve at worst case

tldr: PS - No worst case at code, but worst case at life

Actually, I'm writing my first long post.\
So, how do we start?\
The mentality issue or the financial issue?\
Let's start with the first one.

## The mentality issue

I viewed a guide about for those trying their first open-source program. (Here's [link](https://opensource.guide))\
and I viewed [this](https://opensource.guide/maintaining-balance-for-open-source-maintainers), the post about managing mentality.\
I just viewed it as fun at that time.\
Now, I can't.

## Let's try the burnout checklist together.

from [this post](https://governingopen.com/resources/signs-of-burnout-checklist.html)

>- When you see a notification that someone has opened up a new issue or PR in your project, are you excited that someone is contributing, or do you feel something more like exhaustion or dread?
>- Do you like talking about your project to other people? Do you find yourself hesitant about going to meetups and conferences where people might ask you about your project?
>- Are there ongoing issues with the project? Do you feel hopeful about your ability to eventually resolve them, or hopeless?
>- How often do you enjoy working on the project? Are you able to lose yourself in the work, get into flow states, and emerge from a work session energized and satisfied? Or do you tend to spend your time on things you don't enjoy that much, and that you're only doing because you feel obligated to?
>- Do you feel guilty when you can't address an issue or review a pull request right away?
>- Do you feel like users/contributors are demanding too much of you?
>- Are there specific users/contributors/collaborators who you have to work with, but wish you could avoid?
>- Are you anxious that you're being asked to do things well outside of your wheelhouse? When you're working on the project, how often are you afraid that you'll get something wrong?
>- Do you feel like you could ever take a break (weekend, sickness, vacation, family emergency) from the project? Or can't you leave it alone even for a single day without stuff piling up?
>- Do you get paid to work on your project? If yes, does that make you feel like you can't work on the things you enjoy? If no, do you feel like your work is taken for granted?
>- Think back to what first drew you to the project, whether that was a specific technical challenge, the joy of problem-solving, getting into flow states, collaborationg with others, or participating in a project that had a meaningful impact on the world. Do you still feel that when you work on the project, or is it getting drowned out by other feelings?
1. It's actually exciting.
2. Umm, not everything, but something.
3. It's 50/50.
4. Actually, I'm doing it mechanically, which means I don't have feeling about that anymore.
5. yes.
6. no.
7. no.
8. 90% not afraid/10% afraid.
9. It's second one.
10. I don't paid, and... actually, umm, I don't know.
11. Second one.

So, my result is not great, but not worst.
So you can say, "Why is it the worst case? It's a common thing."

## The friend dies.
I mention friend because I'm not overemotional or overreasonal for that now.\
My friend dies recently and suddenly.\
"Is that friend the best friend?" not really, but good friend.\
If I didn't have a burnout problem, then it wouldn't be as bad as this situation.\

Ok, ok, that's the worst case?\

No.\
I bought Intel at 29$, and "the intel problem" happened.

## The Intel problem

Let's go with the financial issue.\
I just lost 50%, and unfortunately, I bought as much Intel stock as I could when I bought.

## How to solve
I'll rest, maybe 1 week, 1 month, or more.\
Do you remember the phrase that is on my GitHub page?\
"Face the fear, build the future."\
I got that phrase in the game 'Lobotomy Corporation' that related to my favorite game 'Library of Ruina.'\
Now I face the fear, then I'll try to do the next thing.\
That's it; let's end with [my other favorite game's ending.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6aVh9fDYNI)
