tldr: PS - No worst case at code, but worst case at life

Actually, I'm write first long post.\
So, how do we start?\
The mentality issue or The finanical issue?\
Let's start with first one.

## The mentality issue

I viewed guide about try first open-source program. (Here's [link](https://opensource.guide))\
and I viewed [this](https://opensource.guide/maintaining-balance-for-open-source-maintainers), the post about managing mentality.\
I just viewed as fun at that time.\
now, I can't.

## Let's try burnout checklist together.

from [this post](https://governingopen.com/resources/signs-of-burnout-checklist.html)

>- When you see a notification that someone has opened up a new issue or PR in your project, are you excited that someone is contributing, or do you feel something more like exhaustion or dread?
>- Do you like talking about your project to other people? Do you find yourself hesitant about going to meetups and conferences where people might ask you about your project?
>- Are there ongoing issues with the project? Do you feel hopeful about your ability to eventually resolve them, or hopeless?
>- How often do you enjoy working on the project? Are you able to lose yourself in the work, get into flow states, and emerge from a work session energized and satisfied? Or do you tend to spend your time on things you don't enjoy that much, and that you're only doing because you feel obligated to?
>- Do you feel guilty when you can't address an issue or review a pull request right away?
>- Do you feel like users/contributors are demanding too much of you?
>- Are there specific users/contributors/collaborators who you have to work with, but wish you could avoid?
>- Are you anxious that you're being asked to do things well outside of your wheelhouse? When you're working on the project, how often are you afraid that you'll get something wrong?
>- Do you feel like you could ever take a break (weekend, sickness, vacation, family emergency) from the project? Or can't you leave it alone even for a single day without stuff piling up?
>- Do you get paid to work on your project? If yes, does that make you feel like you can't work on the things you enjoy? If no, do you feel like your work is taken for granted?
>- Think back to what first drew you to the project, whether that was a specific technical challenge, the joy of problem-solving, getting into flow states, collaborationg with others, or participating in a project that had a meaningful impact on the world. Do you still feel that when you work on the project, or is it getting drowned out by other feelings?

1. It's actually exciting.
2. Umm, not everything, but something.
3. It's 50/50.
4. Actually, I'm doing it mechanically, which means I don't have feeling about that anymore.
5. yes.
6. no.
7. no.
8. 90% not afraid/10% afraid.
9. You can see my commit history, It's second one.
10. I don't paid, and... actually umm, I don't know.
11. Second one.

so, my result is not great, but not worst.\
So you can say like "why it's worst case, it's common thing."

## The friend dies.
I mention friend, because i don't overemotional or overreasonal for that.\
My friend dies, recently and suddenly.\
"Is that friend the best friend?" not really, but good friend.\
If i didn't have burnout problem, then it'll be not worst as this situation.\
And you know what?\
I bought intel at 29$, and "the intel problem" happened.

## The intel problem
![INTC -50%](../../assets/the-intel-problem.png)

Let's go with financial issue.\
I just lost 50% and unfortunately, I bought all intel stock as I can when I buy.\
and, let's combine this problems.

## How to solve
I'll rest, maybe 1 week, 1 month, or more.\
Do you remember the phrase that in my github page?\
"Face the fear, build the future."\
I got that phrase in game 'Lobotomy Corporation' that related with my favorite game 'Library of ruina'.\
Now I face the fear, then I'll try to do next thing.\
Let me get some phrase.
> "October. This is one of the particularly dangerous months to invest in stocks. Other dangerous months are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February." - Mark Twain

That's it, let's end with [my another favorite game's ending.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6aVh9fDYNI)
