createdDate: 1720155801
tldr: You Are Still Not Safe from the Worst Cyber Crime in History

This post is summarized by [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com)'s claude 3.5 sonnet.

1. KT Corporation has reportedly hacked the devices of approximately 600,000 of its internet service customers.
2. This is a serious threat to cybersecurity and puts all users' personal information at risk. However, the incident has received relatively little attention.
3. The hack was highly sophisticated. KT intercepted network traffic between websites and customers, replaced software with malware, and manipulated or deleted files on customers' devices.
4. This may not be the first time KT has targeted its customers. There's a possibility that they have intercepted networks or inserted malicious code multiple times before.
5. The scale of KT's network means that even non-KT users could be vulnerable to these attacks when using services that pass through KT's infrastructure.
6. The fact that it took 600,000 users reporting issues for this to come to light suggests significant weaknesses in South Korea's cybersecurity systems.
7. It was revealed that the Ministry of Science and ICT had been aware of this crime for at least 9 months but took no action. KT even sued the company that exposed the hacking.
8. This incident highlights the severe imbalance of information and trust between Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and users. Users have no way to verify if their ISP is intercepting thei
r data or inserting malware.
9. KT's attempts to justify the hacking as either legitimate or the work of a few rogue employees are described as absurd and implausible given the sophistication of the attack.
10. The author emphasizes that this is an unprecedented cybercrime in South Korean internet history and deserves much more serious attention and response.

The post strongly criticizes both KT for the alleged hacking and the government for its lack of action, highlighting the vulnerability of internet users and the need for greater cybersecur
ity measures and accountability.
