- Uses predefined functions instead of eval() or Function constructor
- Implements strict Content Security Policy
- Requests minimal permissions (only YouTube domains)
- Follows Manifest V3 requirements for Chrome extensions
- No external dependencies or third-party libraries

## Development

The extension consists of these main files:

- `manifest.json`: Extension configuration (Manifest V3 compliant)
- `background.js`: Background script that intercepts requests and processes responses
- `content.js`: Content script that displays the UI on YouTube pages
- `rules.json`: Declarative rules for network request handling

To build the extension for distribution:

```
# PowerShell
.\zip.ps1
```

This will create a versioned zip file ready for distribution.

- `webRequest`: To intercept web requests (non-blocking)
- `storage`: To store settings and configuration
- `declarativeNetRequest`: For network request handling
- `contextMenus`: For the right-click report menu
- Host permissions for YouTube domains only
