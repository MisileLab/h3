# Announcement About Mekanically and Mekanically: Above (TSAF 01)

## Future of Mekanically

Mekanically will go to LTS state when 1.20 came out and 1.18 is not Forge LTS.

## Future of Mekanically: Above

1.19.2(1.19.4) has great mods but mod provider is seperated and can't use .mrpack or .zip(curseforge), so mekanically: above will changed to packwiz-based modpack, modrinth mod first, but curseforge mod can join too\

## Future of all modpacks

We will follow the forge LTS, not active because has many changes and many mods doesn't support that.

## Future of other projects (Side Note)

We made coin miner and server and we will make a coin wallet with tauri.
