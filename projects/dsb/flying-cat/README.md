## Problems of [butterknife](https://github.com/misilelab/butterknife)

1. It can't get really long messages and context.
2. Since data from X, it only can detect suicidal of x user.
3. It can't be multilingual.

to fix this problems, we adapt [2410.04051](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04501) with
[questions from Columbia University](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/news/simple-set-6-questions-screen-suicide)
and Korean Dataset from actual suicidal users.
