    "content": "Despite a sharp 20% drop in price, U.S.-listed spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw net inflows of nearly $49 million on Monday, indicating strong demand.\n\nMeanwhile, some pointed to the resilience of the Ethereum network in the face of the price drop, indicative of strong fundamentals.\n\nU.S.-listed spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded net inflows of nearly $49 million on Monday amid a 20% drop in its price, showcasing demand for the second-largest token by market capitalization.\n\nEther price cratered as much as 20% on Monday in its biggest one-day price fall since 2021 as prominent crypto trading firm Jump Crypto moved large amounts of the asset to centralized exchanges in preparation for potential sales. A broader crypto market haircut contributed to the selling pressure, with over $340 million in ETH futures liquidations adding to traders' wounds.\n\nProfessional investors bought the dip, however. Data tracked by SoSoValue shows ETH ETFs traded over $715 million, the highest since July 30. BlackRock\u2019s ETHA led inflows at $47 million. Fidelity\u2019s FETH and VanEck\u2019s ETHV recorded $16 million in inflows each.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s ETHE was the only product with outflows at $46 million, while the provider\u2019s smaller Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) recorded inflows at $7 million.\n\nHowever, since they first went live for trading on July 23, the products have recorded net outflows of $460 million, indicating that long-term demand for ETH ETFs has yet to fully appear. Bitcoin ETFs, in contrast, recorded over $1 billion in net inflows within their first 12 days of trading.\n\nETF flows help identify market trends and they broadly show where investors are putting their money.\n\nMeanwhile, some market observers pointed out that applications built on the Ethereum network showed resilience amid the steep declines \u2013 a sign of strong fundamentals.\n\n\u201cEther\u2019s disproportionate price drop was largely driven by the Jump Crypto sell-off and liquidation of other whale wallets,\u201d Alice Liu, lead researcher at CoinMarketCap, told CoinDesk in an email. \u201cOn a positive note, LSDFi stood up to the stress test: there\u2019s been no major increase in Lido\u2019s withdrawal queue, and no liquid staking depends on different projects.\u201d\n\nLSDFi refers to liquid staking derivatives finance, a colloquial term for staking and derivatives. The process refers to a set of blockchain-based activities that allow users to earn rewards while maintaining liquidity through derivative tokens.\n\n\u201cAnother silver lining for ETH is that the recent liquidation seems to have revived the DeFi market, where activities on DeFi started to pick up significantly on the network. Gas fee has also fallen back to a more manageable level of 10-15 Gwei post the 370 Gwei recorded today,\u201d Liu noted, referring to the fees that users pay to use the Ethereum network.",

    "content": "A new report from the NY Fed said Ethereum block builders have largely cooperated with sanctions on Tornado Cash.\n\nBlock validators that are immediately downstream of a transaction are likely to cooperate, the report said, noting that sanctions may not apply to non-U.S. persons.\n\nEthereum block builders have largely cooperated with sanctions on Tornado Cash, despite there still being some activity with the crypto mixer, said a new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe New York Fed published a paper on Wednesday evaluating the effect the Office of Foreign Asset Control's blacklisting of Tornado Cash had on its usage. Mixers are designed to support privacy by obfuscating the origin and destination of transactions, but law enforcement entities like OFAC have targeted several of them due to their use by illicit actors, including North Korea. The U.S. Treasury Department banned all U.S. persons from engaging with it in August 2022.\n\nRoman Storm, one of the developers of Tornado Cash, is currently facing trial over his role in the project, with prosecutors and defense attorneys arguing over whether it is a software tool or a service. Another developer, Alexey Pertsev, was convicted in the Netherlands on similar charges earlier this year.\n\nWednesday's paper suggested that while block validators that are immediately downstream of a transaction are likely to cooperate \u2013 particularly after a court ruling supporting the sanctions \u2013 nodes that are further away from a transaction's origination are less likely to be cooperative.\n\n\"To examine the impact of regulatory clarity and judicial precedent on cooperation, we exploit the timing around the court ruling in August 2023 that ruled in favor of OFAC,\" the paper said. \"We find direct evidence of large builders switching to a cooperative posture following the ruling, giving credence to the idea that clarity around regulation is a pivotal factor to determining whether to cooperate.\"\n\nRead more: Conduct Versus Code May Be the Defining Question in Roman Storm Prosecution\n\nThe paper included the caveat that it was measuring cooperation with the sanctions, but those sanctions may not apply to non-U.S. persons (defined as any citizens or residents and entities) outside of the country. In other words, non-cooperation doesn't necessarily mean anyone is using Tornado Cash in violation of the sanctions.\n\nStill, \"the total value and volume of Tornado Cash drops precipitously\" in the sample period measured, the paper said, and just one entity was responsible for most of the blocks containing funds sent through the mixer.\n\n\"Although Tornado Cash transactions continue to be settled, censorship-resistance appears more tenuous than what the transaction volume suggests,\" the paper said.",

    "headline": "As Restaking Takes Shape on Solana, Ethereum's Renzo Jumps in With 'ezSOL'",
    "content": "Early efforts on the Solana blockchain to develop a framework for \"restaking\" \u2013 a way of securing new protocols and applications without having to spin up additional validator networks \u2013 appear to be gaining traction.\n\nJito Labs, a developer of infrastructure tools for Solana, has yet to launch its planned restaking effort on mainnet. But the mere prospect of this potentially lucrative greenfield is already attracting launch partners.\n\nLiquid restaking protocol Renzo, known primarily for its work on Ethereum-based restaking projects including EigenLayer and Symbiotic, disclosed Wednesday that it's preparing to launch a SOL derivative token, called ezSOL, that offers holders exposure to Jito\u2019s yield-generating infrastructure, plus the extra tokens generated by staking and restaking.\n\nIt\u2019s a change of pace for one of the established players of EigenLayer\u2019s pioneering restaking ecosystem. Renzo\u2019s ezETH is among the Ethereum world\u2019s biggest liquid restaking tokens: It takes users\u2019 ETH or ETH liquid staking tokens and \u201crestakes\u201d them with certain blockchain apps to provide a measure of economic security, generating interest along the way.\n\nThe same general principles will apply in Jito\u2019s upcoming restaking protocol, said Renzo founding contributor Lucas Kozinski, albeit with some different verbiage. EigenLayer refers to blockchain apps secured via restaking as \u201cactively validated services,\u201d or AVSs, whereas Jito calls them Node Consensus Networks (NCNs).\n\n\u201cWe think that restaking is going to be the largest DeFi segment, similar to how liquid staking grew, and because of the complexities associated with restaking, I think everybody focuses on the token, but they don't realize how much infrastructure needs to be run to essentially be able to secure AVSs and in Jito\u2019s cases, NCNs,\u201d Kozinski said.\n\nHow Renzo ezSOL works\n\nRenzo\u2019s ezSOL will work in close proximity to Jito\u2019s own staking token, jitoSOL. Solana users who deposit SOL into Renzo will get back the ezSOL token, Kozinski said. Behind the scenes, Renzo will stake that underlying SOL with Jito to get jitoSOL, where it MEV rewards and gains exposure to the native yield of the Solana blockchain. Renzo will then restake that jitoSOL with NCNs.\n\nDespite some similarities between Renzo\u2019s liquid restaking setups on Ethereum and, soon, Solana, getting it all going is far more complicated than simply plugging the old system into the new. Solana follows an entirely different architecture than Ethereum and its apps are written in a different coding language.\n\nKozinski said he has hired Rust engineers to build smart contracts for ezSOL. A press release said those smart contracts will relay the value generated by restaking into the price of ezSOL. If all goes according to plan, ezSOL will trade in tandem with but slightly higher than SOL, much like Jito\u2019s staking token, jitoSOL does.\n\nSolana also has a different crypto culture than Ethereum. Its user base of crypto traders, stakers and borrowers crossover but hardly match up. Each chain has its share of partisans, some of whom believe this network or that is practically \u2013 sometimes even philosophically \u2013 superior to the other.\n\nThat dynamic helped doom other blockchain apps who tried to cross the cultural and technological chasm. Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking leader Lido once tried to challenge Solana\u2019s resident staking services and gain dominance on both chains. It failed and in February retreated.\n\nThat makes Renzo \u2013 a name brand only in the Ethereum restaking world \u2013 a somewhat unlikely candidate for success on Solana. It isn\u2019t abandoning its Ethereum product, but it is betting expansion to another has more potential than staying put.\n\nKozinski is nevertheless insistent that Renzo can make it work. He said his team is culturally similar to Jito\u2019s and can align in ways that incentivize activity. He also pointed out that Renzo is not working alone. Its product feeds directly into Jito, one of the Solana\u2019s most successful startups to date.\n\n\u201cEthereum users might be interested in using Solana. Solana users might be interested in using Ethereum. But the bigger play here is growing the Renzo user base and bring in that expertise that we've developed over the past year, building on top of EigenLayer,\u201d he said.",

    "content": "Ethereum's gas fees plummeted to a five-year low earlier this week, with some attributing the drop to users and applications migrating to trendier blockchains.\n\nAnalyst Ryan Lee suggests that historical data shows a correlation between low gas fees and a subsequent increase in ETH price.\n\nA steep drop in fees paid to transact on the Ethereum could spell a bullish sign for the network\u2019s underlying ether (ETH) tokens, one analyst said, citing historical data.\n\n\u201cEvery time ETH gas fees drop to rock bottom has often signaled a price bottom in the mid-term,\u201d Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, in Friday note to CoinDesk. \"ETH prices tend to strongly rebound after this cycle, and when this moment coincides with an interest rate cut cycle, the market's wealth effect is full of possibilities.\u201d\n\nGas refers to the necessary cost a user must pay to perform a transaction on the network. Fees dipped as low as 0.6 gwei (a unit of gas) earlier this week with low-priority transactions costing only 1 gwei or lower \u2013 a rare occurrence in recent years. The fees represent a more than 95% drop from the 83.1 gwei levels in March, when the network saw a spike in activity.\n\nLack of demand for Ethereum block space and a preference for using applications on other blockchains has likely led to the drop in fees, Lee said.\n\n\"The drop in Ethereum\u2019s gas fee prices to a five-year low can be attributed to the migration of meme season and Dapp interactions to other faster and cheaper blockchains like Solana and Layer 2, as well as the long-awaited Dencun upgrade that had improved the network efficiency and, therefore, reduced the gas fees,\u201d he explained.\n\nDencun refers to two majors updates from March that changed how transactions were processed and validated on the Ethereum network. Since July, Solana-based application Pump has pocketed more fees than the entire Ethereum network in a single 24-hour period on a few occasions, most recently on August 13.\n\nMeanwhile, the lower amount of ether (ETH) being burned due to lower fees means that the token\u2019s supply has begun to increase.\n\nData shows that nearly 16,000 ETH, or nearly $42 million at current prices, was added to ether's total supply over the past week, pushing supply on track grow 0.7% this year.",

    "content": "A growing number of sophisticated Ethereum users are choosing to transact privately on the blockchain \u2013 relying on so-called dark pools to avoid trading bots set up to front-run transactions, but potentially obscuring the openness and transparency that are supposed to be hallmarks of decentralized public networks.\n\nThat's according to new research compiled by Blocknative, a company that specializes in preventing or minimizing the impact of MEV, which stands for \"maximal extractable value\" \u2013 the profits that can be siphoned off by fast-moving software bots that can quickly enter into trades to skim margin off of transactions that are sitting in the network's public queue, waiting to be processed.\n\nPrivate transactions, which are sent directly to validators or block proposers, instead of public mempools, now account for about half of the total on Ethereum, in terms of the total gas usage \u2013 reflecting the computational power required to process transactions. The percentage was about 7% in September 2022 when Ethereum transitioned into a proof-of-stake network, but it's taken off this year, jumping from about 15% since the start of 2024.\n\nA consequence of the trend is that \"private transaction order flow is only accessible to permission network participants,\" which can be a centralizing force if a smaller number of sophisticated players reap more of the rewards, Blocknative wrote in a blog post discussing the findings.\n\n\"You have a small number of actors who can see the private flow,\" Blocknative CEO Matt Cutler said in an interview. \"Certain people can see stuff, and certain people can't, and that creates opportunity and advantage.\"\n\nThe data might look off to pros who have observed such statistics before. The more typical way of measuring the prevalence of private activity is with transaction count, and that's currently around 30%. As recently as 2022, that share was closer to 4.5%.\n\nBut private transactions tend to be more complex, and thus more \"gas intensive,\" according to Blocknative.\n\n\"By shifting focus to the amount of gas used by private transactions, we gain a more accurate understanding of network dynamics,\" Blocknative wrote in the post.\n\nAmong the disadvantages for users transacting publicly is that fee rates, which fluctuate based on network demand, can be more volatile, and highly unpredictable, Cutler said.\n\n\"Only certain actors like the block builders can see what's going on in the network,\" Cutler said. They have \"exclusive access to certain information. That gives you an edge. It's a big fact of life.\"",

    "headline": "How Ethereum 2.0 Can Transform DeFi",
    "content": "The SEC\u2019s decision in June to drop charges against Ethereum was a milestone in the platform\u2019s journey toward maturity and greater acceptance in the financial world.\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t follow the case, the SEC believed ether (ETH) was sold as an unregistered stock, with concerns that it was being sold without following certain rules and protocols. However, Ethereum\u2019s proponents argued that, since the network is decentralized, it does not meet the criteria of an investment contract or security.\n\nWhile the SEC may have decided against direct legal action, it did open the door for further discussions around centralization. Some technological aspects of Ethereum\u2019s architecture have stimulated an important dialogue around contracting power among influential entities. While these discourses are mainly internal, addressing these concerns can enhance the network\u2019s upgrade goals and support true decentralization.\n\nThis is especially true as the network tries to embody the ideals of \u201cEthereum 2.0,\u201d the stronger, more accessible, and more practical version of its token and infrastructure. Some say it\u2019s already here, while others point out gaps that still need to be filled to definitively claim its arrival.\n\nYes, Ethereum 2.0 holds significant potential for transforming DeFi and the broader ecosystem, but we can\u2019t just have a foot halfway through the door. To reach its full potential, key developments still have to be reached.\n\nValidator centralization\n\nBy transitioning to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism in September 2022, Ethereum now allows validators to stake ETH, with large stakes increasing validation chances and rewards. This upgrade clearly underscores Ethereum\u2019s key role in DeFi by sparking countless innovative financial tools being created on the network for lending and trading, among other use cases.\n\nHowever, emphasizing token ownership over the number of validators could potentially concentrate power among smaller groups, going against crypto\u2019s ethos of decentralization. Moreover, staking requires an input of 32 ETH, meaning that validators with significant ETH staked can wield disproportionate influence over network governance and decision-making processes. This creates a feedback loop that favors certain participants, and can lead to power and wealth accumulating in the hands of a few individuals.\n\nIn March, Vitalik Buterin even expressed his concerns about \u201clazy stakers,\u201d or those who engage solely in staking pools rather than solo staking \u2014 clearly indicating the relevance of the centralization issue.\n\nAt its core, Ethereum represents a shift in the way financial services are designed, accessed, and utilized. However, relying on a few entities continues to introduce risks and questions about how decentralized Ethereum 2.0 really is.\n\nShifting gears to DeFi\n\nEthereum\u2019s path towards centralization sets the stage for more severe complications down the line \u2014 namely with regulators and reduced network resilience. Ultimately, Ethereum\u2019s future within DeFi and the blockchain ecosystem as a whole hinges on balancing technical advancements while limiting centralization wherever possible. And there are ways to make it achievable.\n\nIf implemented correctly, concepts like rainbow staking could further enhance Ethereum\u2019s adaptability while also combatting centralization. In essence, rainbow staking allows users to stake ETH across multiple pools and strategies simultaneously, effectively creating a \u201crainbow of rewards\u201d, so to speak, that stakers receive while mitigating anti-competitive risks and building a more resilient ecosystem. The ETH validation process is separated into \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201clight\u201d staking \u2014 with \u201cheavy\u201d focusing on validation services for finalization and \u201c\u2018light\u201d staking zeroing in on censorship resistance of transactions.\n\nFor example, liquid staking protocols like Lido or Rocket could offer heavy service staking, while existing stakers can opt to run light service operators. Rainbow staking will eventually result in a more efficient and competitive network while granting more liquid staking provider diversity. However, executing it won\u2019t be easy and could add confusion to the overall staking structure.\n\nBeyond rainbow staking, Ethereum could leverage network-wide advancements already introduced in its initial 2.0 updates, like sharding. While sharding has been scrutinized for its security issues, justifying the shift to Layer 2 and zero-knowledge developments, that doesn\u2019t mean the technology should be outright abandoned.\n\nWe have seen evolutions here thanks to developments like \u201cdanksharding\u201d specifically for Layer 2s. Danksharding involves proposer-builder separation (PBS), a deviation from how Ethereum validators function now \u2014 proposing and broadcasting blocks entirely on their own. Instead, PBS shares the love and splits up these tasks among multiple validators.\n\nUltimately, danksharding helps implement data availability, allowing validators to verify blob data quickly and efficiently, while simultaneously identifying missing data.\n\nThe aim here is to make transactions on Layer 2 as cheap as possible for users and scale Ethereum to validate over 100,000 transactions per second. This would allow dApps such as Uniswap to process transactions at a significantly lower cost with quicker transaction approval times.\n\nHowever, danksharding\u2019s highly technical infrastructure and implementation leave out smaller rollups and potentially encourage centralization. So, while the technology has fallen out of favor as is, its benefits in reducing hardware and helping scalability show that the technology itself could be improved upon to benefit the next generation of Ethereum. Perhaps an Ethereum 3.0.\n\nEthereum 2.0\u2019s significant strides in the regulatory and decentralization arenas shouldn\u2019t be ignored. Reducing the network\u2019s reliance on small groups of actors for network operations and legal wins are all positive steps forward. However, the next phase of Ethereum as a network must include adapting to evolving legal requirements to firmly establish itself as a transformative force in DeFi and mainstream blockchain usage alike.\n\nDespite these hurdles, Ethereum 2.0\u2019s current achievements have set the ecosystem on the right path. By focusing on the future and reaffirming a commitment to decentralization, Ethereum has the force behind it to maintain a dominant role as an innovator in the blockchain landscape.\n\nGetting its affairs in order is just a small part of cementing its legacy.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.",

    "headline": "Are Ethereum Staking Yields Too High?",
    "content": "Staking has grown in popularity in recent years due to the availability of staking-as-a-service, pooled staking, and the growth of liquid re-staking. As of July 2024, Ethereum's security budget amounts to a staggering $110 billion worth of ETH, representing roughly 28% of the total ETH supply. There is also a general adoption of staking features within exchanges and financial applications allowing people to allocate their ETH to secure the Ethereum network. Many view staking as a low-risk return on investment, which makes it appealing to ETH holders. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, holds a portion of his ETH staked, although he still keeps a part of it unstaked.\n\nYou're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nAs staking grows in popularity through liquid staking derivatives, there is a need to better quantify staking returns for different platforms and how they change over time. One way to do this is using the Composite Ether Staking Rate (CESR) oracle feed which is a standardized on-chain Ethereum Staking Rate. This can act as a useful benchmark when considering trends in staking. It is crucial to better quantify trends in staking and consider their ramifications, while also pointing out the benefit of generating additional revenues for ETH holders.\n\nWhy Might We Consider Lowering ETH Issuance?\n\nAlthough staking is essential to Ethereum's security, there are compelling arguments for reducing the ETH issuance rate.\n\nDiminishing Returns on Security: Beyond a certain point, adding more validators contributes less to network security. The marginal benefit decreases while the costs \u2014 mainly through ETH issuance \u2014 continue to rise.\n\nIncreased Costs for Validators: As more staking occurs, the operational costs, such as hardware upkeep, also rise. These costs often trickle down to users, making the network more expensive to maintain.\n\nCentralization Risks: With large entities or staking pools controlling significant portions of staked ETH, the risk of centralization increases. This could compromise the very decentralization that Ethereum seeks to preserve.\n\nDilution and Inflation: Excessive issuance of new ETH to reward validators leads to inflation, which dilutes the value of existing ETH holdings.\n\nThe Future of Staking\n\nStaking, particularly through liquid re-staking, is rapidly evolving. As Ethereum continues to innovate, it will be important to better quantify trends in this corner of the market.

And then the silent treatment.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote on X that he will be weighing in on layer 2 networks differently in his public posts from now on \u2013 omitting mentions of those projects that aren't decentralized enough.\n\nTo merit any ink, they have to at least meet a decentralization threshold known as \"Stage 1,\" under a hierarchy he laid out years ago in a blog post.\n\n\u201cStarting next year, I plan to only publicly mention (in blogs, talks, etc) L2s that are stage 1+,\u201d Buterin wrote. \u201cIt doesn't matter if I invested, or if you're my friend; stage 1 or bust.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, Buterin proposed a set of stages for rollups, to classify them in their pursuit of decentralization. The criteria is meant to showcase that rollups tend to rely on \u201ctraining wheels\u201d and deploy their protocols to users before it's ready to fully decentralize.\n\n\u201cWhile a project\u2019s tech is still immature, the project launches early anyway to allow the ecosystem to start forming, but instead of relying fully on its fraud proofs or ZK proofs, there is some kind of multisig that has the ability to force a particular outcome in case there are bugs in the code,\u201d Buterin wrote in a blog post in 2022.\n\nIn blockchain terms, multisig is short for a key that can be controlled by combining multiple signatures \u2013 often representing a small group of people who could make changes under emergency conditions, essentially bypassing the typical consensus process used to validate the network.\n\nTaking off the 'training wheels'\n\nButerin has categorized the projects in three different stages, ranging from 0 to 2. Stage 0 is when a layer 2 network relies on full training wheels. Stage 1 is when it has limited training wheels, but is running with fraud proofs \u2013 an important cryptographic process that avoids the need for a single centralized entity to settle any layer-2 transactions to the base Ethereum blockchain. Stage 2 means a project is fully decentralized.\n\nL2Beat, a layer-2 dashboard, tracks how the different layer-2 protocols rank in terms of those different stages. Currently, none of the leading rollups has reached Stage 2.\n\nAt Stage 1, only Arbitrum One, OP Mainnet, and zkSync lite have reached this stage.\n\n\u201cThe era of rollups being glorified multisigs is coming to an end,\" Buterin wrote on X. \"The era of cryptographic trust is upon us.\u201d\n\nRead more: Vitalik Buterin Reflects On Strengths, Weaknesses of Ethereum, 'Hardening' the Blockchain",

    "content": "The announcement of Binance listing First Neiro on Ethereum (NEIRO) for spot trading triggered a massive 700% price surge, catapulting its market cap from $15 million to $146 million in a day, with trading volumes skyrocketing from $8 million to over $220 million.\n\nBinance's decision to list two different NEIRO tokens, one for futures and another for spot trading, each with distinct contract addresses, has led to community backlash and confusion over which token represents the \"true\" NEIRO.\n\nNEIRO, inspired by Neiro, a Shiba Inu related to the Dogecoin mascot Kabosu, has spawned multiple tokens across blockchains. Despite the community's enthusiasm, Kabosumama, Neiro's owner, has explicitly distanced herself from endorsing any NEIRO tokens.\n\nA Binance spot listing of a token related to dogecoin {{DOGE}} has fueled a 700% rally in its prices, one of the biggest jumps on a listing in recent months.\n\nBinance said early Monday it would offer First Neiro on Ethereum (NEIRO), and two other tokens, as part of its spot offering to users later in the day. The influential exchange already offers Neiro tokens as a futures product - and a subsequent spot listing is an industry practice.\n\nThe twist, however, is that the two NEIRO tokens have different contract addresses and are maintained by different teams.\n\n\u201cThis Futures listing is for 'First Neiro On Ethereum' (NEIRO) with the contract address here for verification: 0x812ba41e071c7b7fa4ebcfb62df5f45f6fa853ee,\u201d Binance said in an announcement.\n\n\u201cThis is a different token from the NEIROETH Futures listing dated 2024-09-06 (a different token contract address for verification here: 0xee2a03aa6dacf51c18679c516ad5283d8e7c2637),\u201d it said.\n\nCommunity reactions to Binance\u2019s X post were widely critical of the decision.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re listing two different Neiro on spot and futures?\u201d wrote @0x_degengod. \u201cHow are you gonna list the 15M Neiro when you already have the 130M on futures,\u201d exclaimed @cozypront.\n\nNEIRO tokens jumped over 700% instantly after the Binance announcement, before paring gains, zooming from a market capitalization of $146 million from Sunday\u2019s $15 million. Trading volumes jumped from $8 million in a 24-hour-period over Saturday to Sunday, to over $220 million in the past 24 hours.\n\nBinance data shows that the existing futures of the NEIROETH token has bagged nearly $1 billion in trading volumes in the past 24 hours. Its prices are down 40% since early Asian trading hours Monday, with most losses coming after Binance decided to list the First Neiro on Ethereum token (listed under only \u201cNEIRO\u201d) on its platform.\n\nWhat is Neiro?\n\nNeiro is a Shiba Inu pup owned by the same person whose pet dog Kabosu inspired the popular dogecoin memecoin. Kabosu passed away in May at the age of 17, leaving a legacy that includes a statue and a memecoin worth $18 billion.\n\nIn late May Kabosumama, the X account of Kabosu's human owner, adopted a ten-year-old Shiba Inu dog named Neiro and called her a \u201cnew family member.\u201d\n\nThat birthed hundreds of NEIRO memecoins on Ethereum, Solana and other blockchains at the time. Eventually, two NEIROs - one on Ethereum and one on Solana - attracted enough trading volumes and market interest to form an active holders community. Both communities still consider their NEIRO is be the actual, original one.\n\nKabosumama, on her part, has distanced herself from all NEIRO tokens and said in May that she does not endorse any such tokens.",

    "content": "It's only been six months since Ethereum, the dominant smart-contract blockchain, had its last major upgrade. But there are so many developer priorities for what to tackle next that there's a growing realization they can't all happen at once.\n\nSo now, Ethereum developers are considering dividing the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade into two parts.\n\nPectra was on track to be Ethereum\u2019s biggest hard fork to date. (A hard fork, in this case, is the technical blockchain term for the software upgrade.), But some developers argue that the entire package of new features has become unwieldy, and they have expressed a desire to split it due to its complexities, and the risk of doing too much, too fast.\n\nDuring an All Core Developers call last week, Ethereum developers started to play with the idea that splitting the hard fork into two might be feasible.\n\nEF DevOps Engineer Parithosh Jayanthi, who was one of the core developers pushing to split Pectra, told CoinDesk over Telegram that \u201cwe\u2019re talking about splitting it into two forks, mainly to reduce the risk of a bug and to enable faster shipping of both forks.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report by Christine Kim, vice president of research at Galaxy Digital, the first part of Pectra would include Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) including EIP-7702, which aims to improve wallets \u2013 famously scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 22 minutes. The second part would see EIPs aimed at upgrading Ethereum\u2019s Virtual Machine, known as EOF.\n\nOn Thursday, Ethereum developers will decide in their upcoming All Core Developers Consensus layer call if Pectra will be split into two forks.\n\nPossible downside\n\nIf developers agree on the split, the first package could come in 2025, as early as February.\n\nEthereum developers haven\u2019t disagreed much with the potential of splitting the fork, though EF researcher Ansgar Dietrichs toldCoinDesk that one downside would be pushing EIP-7594, or PeerDAS, to the second package. PeerDAS aims to improve data availability on Ethereum, and with the delay in the feature going live, there might be slightly higher fees for layer-2 blockchains for the time being.\n\n\u201cPeerDAS is crucial to make sure L2s have more room for future throughput growth, so the sooner we ship it, the more certain we can be that we can support whatever throughput L2s might need over the next year,\u201d Dietrichs told CoinDesk. \u201cFor now, we still have some room to go even before PeerDAS. So hopefully it won\u2019t matter at all. Worst case, L2s will have slightly higher fees again for a few months while we wait for the second half of the Pectra fork.\u201d\n\nDietrichs said that, \"Ultimately, I think a split is likely still the right decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think everyone agrees that it's a really big fork, so a natural thing to do is just to break it into two,\u201d said EF Researcher Alex Stokes on last week\u2019s call, according to Kim\u2019s report. \u201cGenerally, smaller forks are less risky.\u201d\n\nRead more: Ethereum Set for Overhaul of Crucial Programming Standard With 'EVM Object Format'",

Developers had discussed previously that Pectra was becoming too ambitious to ship all at once, floating the idea of splitting it up in order to minimize the risk of finding bugs in the code.\n\nPectra was on track to be Ethereum\u2019s biggest hard fork to date. (A hard fork is the technical term for when a blockchain splits from its original, and is the method used by Ethereum to implement major software upgrades.) Now, developers will be able to focus on a much narrower scope. Previously, developers shared they would aim to have the upgrade live in early 2025; that is still the case for the first part of the Pectra package.\n\nThe core developers decided that eight Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) will be included in the first package, which includes EIP-7702, aimed at improving the user-experience of wallets, and famously scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 22 minutes.\n\nThe second package is up to be changed over the next few months, but as of now could include proposals that aim to make changes to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, known as EOF, along with introducing a feature called PeerDAS, which improves data availability sampling and ultimately is beneficial for layer-2 blockchains.\n\nThe developers acknowledged that the scopes of these upgrades can change over time, so solidifying this upgrade wouldn't be wise in this moment.\n\n\"There seems to be agreements to split current Pectra somehow,\" said Ethereum Foundation researcher Alex Stokes, who led the call. \"And then downstream, we can figure out what comes next.\"\n\n\u201cI hear everyone that, it can be tricky to not want to put new things in. I would lean towards, again, keeping the scope very small, just because then that's going to maximize our chances of actually shipping the second fork very quickly with respect to this first one,\u201d Stokes added.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Devs Poised to Split Blockchain's Next Big Upgrade, 'Pectra,' in Two",

    "content": "Ether ETFs experienced the largest outflows since July, with over $79 million exiting on Monday.\n\nThe outflows were predominantly from Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), while Bitwise's ETHW saw minor inflows, highlighting the strength of Grayscale's influence on market dynamics.\n\nDespite an 11% rise in ether due to favorable macroeconomic conditions like Fed rate cuts, the ETF outflows indicate a disconnect between prices and investor sentiment toward ether's future.\n\nEther may not resonate with traditional finance investors as much as bitcoin's \"digital gold\" narrative, some observers say.\n\nEther {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their largest net outflows since July, with over $79 million exiting on Monday in a sign of waning institutional demand for the world\u2019s second-largest token.\n\nThose figures are the highest since July 29, when ETH ETHs recorded a cumulative $98 million, and the four-highest since they first went live on July 23, data from SoSoValue shows.\n\nNearly all of Monday\u2019s outflows came from Grayscale\u2019s ETHE product. Bitwise\u2019s ETHW recorded just over $1.3 million in inflows. Other products showed no inflow or outflow activity.\n\nThe outflow came despite a broader crypto market rally fueled by last week's Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, which helped lift ether prices by 11% over the past week. The disconnect between ETH\u2019s price momentum and ETF flows suggests that investors remain uncertain about the asset\u2019s long-term growth prospects.\n\nA closely watched ratio tracking the relative price strength of ether and bitcoin {{BTC}} has dropped to its lowest level since April 2021, as CoinDesk previously reported, a sign the broader market favors bitcoin's perceived stability over ether's riskier, high-yield potential.\n\nAccording to Peter Chung, head of research at Presto Labs, the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s \u201cworld computer\u201d narrative does not resonate as easily with traditional finance (TradFi) investors as bitcoin\u2019s \u201cdigital gold\u201d meme.\n\n\u201cTradFi investors may not respond as enthusiastically to ETH\u2019s investment thesis than to BTC\u2019s. Gold\u2019s investment thesis as an inflation hedge is well-known, and therefore, it is not a leap for TradFi investors to wrap their heads around the idea of \u2018digital gold,\u201d Chung said in a message to CoinDesk, referring to an August report by the firm on the topic. \u201cOn the other hand, ETH\u2019s \u2018world computer\u2019 narrative is much more difficult for non-technicals to grasp.\n\n\u201cEven if they manage to come around, their conviction level would need to be high enough to justify adding a second digital asset exposure after a BTC ETF. This could be challenging because, for those who have already allocated to a BTC ETF in their portfolio, adding another digital asset exposure provides substantially less incremental diversification benefit than the first exposure,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin set fresh lifetime highs in March in U.S. dollars (before tumbling 20%), while ether is yet to break its highs from 2021 and is still about only half that level. Year-to-date, bitcoin has returned over 50% , while ether has gained just under 15%.\n\nAugustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA.org, noted that while ETH has gained on the back of the Fed\u2019s dovish turn, the heavy ETF outflows indicate a fragile sentiment.\n\n\u201cWill a continued price rally rescue ETH ETF inflows from their current doldrums? The answer likely depends on whether we see another blow-off top in equity markets before November,\u201d Fan said. \u201cEthereum has gained 11% over the past week on no new developments. However, the latest heavy outflow from Ether ETFs indicates uncertain sentiment among investors on its future growth momentum.\u201d\n\nNick Ruck, an independent market analyst, pointed out that the recent outflows could be linked to broader pessimism about ether's growth narrative.\n\n\u201cThe surge in ETH ETF outflows may stem from investors allocating capital elsewhere due to the ongoing pessimistic outlook for ETH, and the current increase in the price of ETH is a good opportunity to exit the market,\u201d Ruck said in a Tuesday message to CoinDesk. \u201cEthereum has been criticized recently for failing to push any narratives that could help attract more inflows. However, the new Pectra upgrade set to launch in Feb 2025 aims to enable users to pay gas fees with altcoins, among other benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstitutional investors may feel there are better opportunities elsewhere for the time being,\u201d Ruck added.\n\nCORRECTION (Sept. 24, 07:55 UTC): Corrects month of bitcoin record high in sixth paragraph before the end.",

    "content": "Ethereum\u2019s ability to host a wide-range of applications and assets has been evident for years, but the investment case for its native token, ETH, has become increasingly complex. In the wake of key protocol changes, particularly the hardforks activating EIP-1559 and EIP-4844, investors are asking how Ethereum\u2019s adoption will translate into ETH\u2019s long-term value.\n\nWhile the platform has scaled, the relationship between its growth and ETH\u2019s supply and demand \u2014 and thus its price \u2014 is no longer as straightforward as it once seemed.\n\nYou're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nThe EIP-1559 revolution: linking utility to token value\n\nWhen Ethereum implemented EIP-1559 in 2021, it introduced a burn mechanism where the overwhelming majority of transaction fees (base fees) would be permanently removed from circulation. This created a direct relationship between Ethereum usage and ETH\u2019s supply. As users paid for transactions on the Ethereum network, the burn would act as a deflationary force, reducing ETH\u2019s supply and putting upwards pressure on its price.\n\nIn 2023, our valuation model at CoinShares showed that under the right conditions, where Ethereum generated $10 billion annually in L1 transaction fees, something it achieved at its 2021 heights, ETH could reach a value near $8,000 by 2028.\n\nSince then, however, optimism has waned due to the Dencun hardfork and the rise of Layer-2s (L2), which have upended the fee burn and altered ETH\u2019s value potential.\n\nThe rise of layer-2s: a double-edged sword\n\nL2 platforms were designed to scale Ethereum by moving transactions off the main chain (L1) and onto faster, cheaper networks. Initially, L2s complemented L1, helping the network handle more transactions without clogging the base chain \u2014 like a pressure release valve giving balance in times of high usage.\n\nBut with the introduction of \u201cblob space\u201d in 2024, L2s could now settle transactions on L1 at much lower costs, reducing their requirement to pay expensive L1 fees. As more activity migrated to L2s, the supply burn that EIP-1559 was designed to instill began to drop, weakening the downward pressure on ETH\u2019s supply.\n\nThe reality of Ethereum generating high L1 fees to support ETH\u2019s value is now looking bleak. L1 transaction fees have steadily collapsed, leading to questions about what differentiates the services offered at each layer, and what will drive the L1 fee landscape moving forward.\n\nA path forward: restoring the burn or adapting to new realities\n\nDespite these challenges, there are potential paths forward to restore demand for L1 transactions and, in turn, ETH valuation.\n\nOne option is developing high-value use cases that rely on L1\u2019s security and reliability, yet, given current trends, this appears unlikely in the near future. Another possibility is that L2 adoption grows so rapidly that the sheer volume of transactions compensates for the discounted fees \u2014 but this would require extraordinary L2 growth, beyond near-term expectations.\n\nThe most likely, and perhaps the most controversial, solution is repricing blob space to increase L2 settlement fees. While this would restore some of the L1 supply burn, it risks upsetting the economics of L2s that have been key to Ethereum\u2019s recent success and enhanced its ability to compete as an ecosystem with alternative platforms (like Solana, Binance Chain, etc.).\n\nThe uncertain future of ETH\n\nWhile L2s have scaled Ethereum, they have also disoriented the mechanisms that tie ETH\u2019s value to its utility. For investors, this means that ETH\u2019s future depends on how Ethereum balances innovation with maintaining healthy economic policy.\n\nFor now, ETH\u2019s investment case is unsettling, and risks remain high as the Ethereum community decides its path forward.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.",

    "headline": "Ethereum Proposal Could Increase Throughput by 50%",
    "content": "The new Ethereum improvement proposal, officially EIP-7781, would increase throughput by 50%.\n\nThe submission from Illyriad Games co-founder Ben Adams follows earlier proposals by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and others for improving the blockchain's overall processing capacity.\n\nEthereum has faced growing criticism that it has failed to scale the main blockchain, since it has mainly pushed in recent years to enable the proliferation of affiliated layer-2 networks that are optimized for higher transaction execution.\n\nDrawbacks include the possibility that validators might need additional resources to support the higher throughput.\n\nA new upgrade proposal for Ethereum could improve network throughput by 50%, enhancing its ability to compete with speed-focused blockchains like Solana.\n\nInitially proposed on Oct. 5 by Ben Adams, co-founder of Illyriad Games, the Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) would reduce slot times from 12 seconds to eight seconds, allowing the network to process more transactions over time.\n\nThe upgrade, officially designated EIP-7781, would also ramp up the blockchain's capacity to handle blobs, which are dedicated data-storage chambers used by affiliated layer-2 networks to stash transaction records. The change would effectively increase the number of blobs per block to nine from six, providing more space for layer-2 chains like Arbitrum and Optimism to post data to Ethereum.\n\nIn Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, slots refer to specific time intervals during which a block can be proposed. A validator is selected for each slot to propose a block, and if successful, the block is added to the blockchain.\n\nThe upgrade proposal will need to work its way through the Ethereum open-source development system, but it's already earned some key supporters.\n\nVitalik Buterin's proposal\n\nEthereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake noted on Github that reducing block times to eight seconds would make decentralized exchange (DEX) platforms like Uniswap 1.22 times more efficient. The change could help close pricing gaps between on-chain and off-chain trading venues, saving users up to $100 million per year, according to Drake.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is praised for having strong security and a high degree of decentralization relative to most other blockchains, but its benefits have historically come at the cost of relatively high fees and slow speeds \u2013 at least in comparison to newer blockchains like Solana.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed in January to increase the blockchain's \"gas limit\" \u2013 the total size of transactions that can be squeezed into each block \u2013 as a way of boosting the overall network throughput.\n\nEIP-7781 would be tantamount to an \"effective increase to a 45M gas limit and 9 blob limit,\" which \"roughly aligns with the proposed 40M gas limit by pumpthegas.org and the 8 blob limit by Vitalik and others,\u201d according to Drake.\n\nOver the past few years, upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain have primarily focused on paving the way for the development of third-party layer-2 \"rollup\" networks like Arbitrum and Optimism. These independent blockchain networks officially settle their transactions on Ethereum's ledger, but they offer users higher speeds and lower fees and have rapidly become the primary venue through which users interact with the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nData blobs were added to Ethereum in March to allow the blockchain to hold arbitrary bits of data in a separate, dedicated space that's cheaper than regular block space on the network. Compared to regular transactions, blobs are better optimized for layer-2 networks, which bundle together big groups of transactions and post them to Ethereum all at once.\n\nEIP-7781 could help make it faster (and cheaper) for layer-2 networks to post data to the chain by increasing the number of blobs, but it is also the first upgrade in some time to focus directly on improving speeds on the base Ethereum blockchain.\n\nReducing slot times to eight seconds from 12 would directly translate to faster transactions for end-users, but it risks adding strain for validators, who might need additional hardware resources.\n\nThe news was reported earlier in CoinTelegraph.",

    "headline": "LatAm Bank Littio Ditches Ethereum for Avalanche as Demand for RWA Vaults Grows",
    "content": "Littio, a Colombian neobank, is enabling customers to access U.S. Treasury bills through crypto products.\n\nLittio is switching vault holdings from Ethereum (ETH) to Avalanche (AVAX) to scale the products.\n\nLaunched in February, the vaults have already garnered $80 million in trading volume.\n\nIt\u2019s getting easier for Latin Americans to gain exposure to U.S. Treasury bills.\n\nColombian neobank Littio is switching blockchain networks \u2013 from Ethereum {{ETH}} to Avalanche {{AVAX}} \u2013 for products, called Yield Pots, that allow users to earn interest on their U.S. dollar deposits.\n\nWhy the change? Growing demand for Yield Pots is forcing the operation to scale. Avalanche\u2019s low transaction fees and consistency were cited as reasons for picking the chain.\n\nThe Avalanche Foundation launched a $50 million program last year to incentivize the development of real-world assets (RWAs) on its network and this news is a nice win for the platform.\n\nDemand for U.S. Treasury bills\n\nLittio offers exposure to Yield Pots through its partnership with OpenTrade, a London-based firm that develops yield-bearing products by using stablecoins and real-world assets like U.S. Treasury bills.\n\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to stay at par with a government-issued currency, typically the U.S. dollar. Real-world assets is a term for assets that exist outside of the crypto ecosystem such as real estate, but are represented on-chain in the form of digital tokens.\n\n\u201cCurrently, [Littio] is the only Latin American neobank using [our vaults], but we have more clients set to come online this year offering different types of USDC-based fintech services,\u201d Jeff Handler, chief commercial officer at OpenTrade, told CoinDesk.\n\n\u201cInterested clients are primarily neobanks, centralized exchanges, and payment companies that are already using USDC to fill a gap in demand in USD bank accounts, [USD] payments and [USD] services across Latin America,\u201d Handler added\n\nThe company is available in various Latin American countries, including Colombia, Argentina, El Salvador, Brazil and Mexico.\n\nThough Littio\u2019s Yield Pots only launched in February, they have already garnered over $80 million in transaction volume. They have also brought $250,000 in returns to users in the last four months. Littio holds and reinvests between $11 million and $13 million in OpenTrade vaults per month, Handler said.\n\nFor comparison, U.S. financial giant Franklin Templeton\u2019s tokenized money market fund \u2013 which, quite similarly, allows registered users to gain exposure to U.S. Treasuries \u2013 has amassed $435 million in assets since its inception in 2021.\n\nThe yield from Littio\u2019s vaults vary between 2% and 5%, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\nIt makes sense that the product would attract demand: The Colombian peso is down more than 54% against the U.S. dollar in the last 10 years and has lost 88% since 1990. And it\u2019s not the only Latin American currency facing serious inflation. The dollar looks alluring by contrast.\n\nDepending on where they\u2019re located, Littio customers might also face currency restrictions or a lack of means to open bank accounts through their country\u2019s traditional financial rails \u2014 providing them another reason to sign up for Littio.\n\n\u201cLittio and OpenTrade exemplify how Avalanche\u2019s technology can enable underbanked populations to access compelling products and services that are otherwise unavailable or untenable via traditional rails leverage,\u201d said Morgan Krupetsky, head of institutions and capital markets at Ava Labs, which develops the Avalanche blockchain.",

    "headline": "Has Ethereum Lost Its Way?",
    "content": "Ethereum has come a long way since the network went live in 2015 under the codename Frontier, transforming from a grand idea into what is now the foundation for thousands of decentralized applications.\n\nStill, with a rise in blockchains like Bitcoin and Solana competing for Ethereum\u2019s developer and user base, the ecosystem is beginning to falter and lack direction, losing sight of what it originally intended to do. Even its value remains a bit flat. Ethereum\u2019s token price still hasn\u2019t successfully broken its all-time high of $4700, which it reached in 2021.\n\nThis raises the question, has Ethereum lost its way? If so, how do we get it back on track?\n\nAs Confucius once said, \u201cThe man who chases two rabbits, catches neither.\u201d Between chasing Solana\u2019s faster execution and the ultra-sound money narrative that competes with Bitcoin\u2019s hard money, Ethereum has lost sight of its original vision of becoming the World Computer. P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi, an Ethereum Team Lead, said \u201cEthereum is losing the plot.\u201d Even Ethereum\u2019s \u201cultrasound money\u201d status is being questioned as its inflation rate reaches 0.74%, driven by the reduced transaction activity and ETH burn rate. While others advocate for ETH to retain its deflationary nature, it is important to remember that ultrasound money was never the goal.\n\nEthereum is more than just a currency and it has never been about having the fastest TPS or the lowest gas fees; it has always been about building a truly decentralized future. Vitalik Buterin and other co-founders created Ethereum to become a World Computer \u2014 a universal network consisting of thousands of computers on which anyone can build decentralized applications from anywhere. While building to enhance accessibility and interoperability, the ecosystem is distracted by the latest trends and has lost focus.\n\nWith the price dropping below $2500, it\u2019s been thought that the cause of ETH underperforming is related to the applications being built on the network. Many of today\u2019s dApps on Ethereum gain short-term hype, but the reputation of a clunky UI and underdeveloped platforms lead to limited usage and slow user growth. Additionally, these applications often garner the attention of the same users siloed in various L2s. Without usable applications, Ethereum can't reach its goal of becoming the World Computer.\n\nEthereum\u2019s primary ambitions hinge on robust infrastructure, not applications. Decentralized compute, with secondary and tertiary networks that feed into Ethereum, are being developed as we speak, indicating how Ethereum\u2019s infrastructure is showing signs of advancement. Even enterprises are beginning to favor permissionless networks like Ethereum over private corporate networks now that it\u2019s become much cheaper to develop on permissionless chains.\n\nBut, even with these advancements, Ethereum is still improving at a slow place with the network stuck in the middle of the scaling roadmap, a less exciting time where Merkle Trees, zkSTARKS, account abstraction, and technologies that unify desperate L2s are coming to fruition.\n\nThere needs to be less short-term thinking. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum will come out of the doldrums of seemingly little activity. Ethereum is having its \u201cLightning moment\u201d and it needs to drop the ultra-sound money narrative and stop trying to catch Solana. Ethereum has a clear path to fix this for those who pay attention. For example, we still haven\u2019t seen how people will use Blobs beyond being a space for rollup fraud-proof challenge windows.\n\nFollowing the Dencun upgrade in March, Pectra is the next major Ethereum upgrade scheduled for the end of 2024, and further down Ethereum\u2019s roadmap is The Purge. This upgrade will play an important role in Ethereum keeping pace with other chains and handling the influx of activity once the chain achieves broader adoption. The Purge will simplify the protocol by clearing old history, which will eliminate technical debt and reduce costs of participating in the network.\n\nWhile removing historical state comes with benefits, it leaves the chain vulnerable to data being gobbled up by centralized entities making Ethereum a data-centered chain. Ethereum then becomes more of a billboard with less trustlessness properties. This problem hinders the next phase of the World Computer because downstream activity, like multi-agent AI systems and decentralized compute, can\u2019t scale if there\u2019s no data to look to. This is solved through one type of solution: decentralized long-term data availability.\n\nYes, right now, Ethereum is stuck in the middle of the scaling roadmap. However, Ethereum can get back on track by directing its focus to infrastructure. This is what will truly allow the network to fulfill its role as the World Computer. As Ethereum reaches the end of the roadmap and achieves decentralized compute in the years to come, the World Computer will function effortlessly bolstered by none other than robust global infrastructure.\n\nNote: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.",

    "headline": "Why This ETF Expert Is Bullish on Ethereum and Says Washington\u2019s Crypto Stance Is Misunderstood",
    "content": "The crypto ETF era is just getting started, according to Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer of crypto fund issuer Bitwise.\n\nCrypto-native investors that have soured on Ethereum's ether (ETH) are underestimating its appeal to TradFi investors and developers.\n\nCrypto is in a great spot no matter who wins the U.S. election, he argues.\n\nIt\u2019s been a great year for Bitwise Asset Management.\n\nThe specialist in developing crypto investment products launched two of the most successful exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of all time. Its spot bitcoin ETF has amassed more than $2.7 billion in the span of nine months, while its spot ether ETF has raked in over $250 million in 84 days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re holding our own against BlackRock and Fidelity,\u201d Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan told CoinDesk, referring to two giants of traditional finance that have vastly larger operations than Bitwise. \u201cThere are people who want a crypto-native asset manager to survive.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not all. The company grew its assets under management from roughly $1 billion to $5 billion, Hougan said, and Bitwise\u2019s acquisition of ETC Group \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) issuer \u2013 means the firm now has a solid footing on the old continent.\n\nIf you listen to Hougan, they\u2019re just getting started.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve entered the ETF era of crypto,\u201d he said. That means crypto is going to be normalized in people\u2019s portfolios, and a growing cohort of investors will want access to a wide array of crypto investment vehicles, be it single-asset (like the spot bitcoin ETFs) or multi-asset products (which could combine bitcoin and ether, for example).\n\nCase in point, on Oct. 7 Bitwise filed to convert three of its crypto futures ETFs into strategy-based trend-following funds, which rotate out of the market when it loses momentum, with the goal of providing exposure to volatility to investors while minimizing downside risk.\n\nBitwise\u2019s ascent is happening in a context of quick technological innovation in crypto, with settlement times and transaction fees getting ever lower \u2013 which means crypto applications can now become mainstream much faster than people think, according to Hougan. And shifting political tides in Washington could indicate that, as far as regulatory roadblocks go, the worst is behind us.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be all sunshine and roses, it will still be imperfect. I just think it will be better than in the past,\u201d Hougan said.\n\nEthereum\u2019s appeal\n\nIf the tremendous success of bitcoin ETFs is the story of the year, the comparatively disappointing ether ETF flows has turned sentiment \u2013 at least on Crypto Twitter \u2013 against the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\n\u201cInside crypto, many people look at Ethereum as old tech and would rather talk about Solana or Sui or Monad or Aptos or whatever,\u201d Hougan said.\n\nBut for him, they\u2019re missing the bigger picture.\n\nThe bulk of the $170 billion stablecoin market is issued on Ethereum, Hougan pointed out, and the majority of tokenization projects \u2013 like BlackRock\u2019s BUIDL fund or DeFi protocol Ondo \u2013 are being built on it, too. Same with the most popular crypto apps, like Uniswap or Aave.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Microsoft of blockchains, because Microsoft is like this really boring old tech company from the '70s and it's still the third-largest company in the world,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cIf you work at a large bank and you're trying to tokenize an asset, you're not going to get fired for putting it on Ethereum.\u201d\n\nIn that sense, Ethereum is the platform for killer crypto applications. So, the network is being sold to investors because it has utility \u2013 the fact that it also produces cash flow doesn\u2019t hurt at all.\n\nIn fact, Hougan said that among clients, interest for bitcoin {{BTC}} and Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} is neatly divided in half. Those with concerns about the monetary situation and the fate of the U.S. dollar will naturally gravitate toward bitcoin, while the rest tend to be much more excited about everything being built on top of Ethereum.\n\n\u201cOne thing that I'm really confident about is that 2025 flows in ether ETFs will exceed 2024 flows. And I bet 2026 flows will exceed 2025 flows,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cI just think Ethereum takes somewhat more education than bitcoin, but that education is happening.\u201d\n\nThe complexities of Washington\n\nAnother major development this year? The feeling that in Washington, crypto isn\u2019t taboo anymore.\n\nThe White House took an adversarial stance towards crypto through most of U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s term \u2013 for example, going out of its way to veto a controversial accounting measure, SAB 121, which makes it hard for banks to custody crypto. But things started to change when former President Donald Trump said in May that he\u2019d champion the industry. He then doubled down by vowing to constitute a strategic bitcoin reserve, to free Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht from prison and to help the bitcoin mining industry develop in the U.S.\n\nTrump\u2019s promises stood in stark contrast to the Biden administration\u2019s cold antagonism. And with half of all corporate election spending coming from crypto companies, the Democratic Party softened its stance. Vice President Kamala Harris, the party\u2019s candidate for the presidential election, pithily expressed support toward blockchain technology in September.\n\nThe important thing for crypto investors to understand is that, no matter who wins the presidential election in three weeks, things are never completely black and white, Hougan said.\n\nIt\u2019s not that \u201cWashington is either pro-crypto or anti-crypto,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cPoliticians can be overtly hostile and absurdly positive \u2026 and they can be anything in between.\u201d\n\nFor example, in 2024 the crypto industry obtained the approval of bitcoin ETFs and ether ETFs, Hougan said, and suffered in September from a \u201clighter SEC enforcement season than we have in any of the past three years.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompare that track record to what we got in 2022 or 2023. In those years, we just got kicked in the shins, and in this year, we got some wins,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cDid we get a solana ETF? No, but it\u2019s a spectrum.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why a Harris presidency probably wouldn\u2019t be as bad for crypto as the Biden administration has been \u2013 even if she doesn\u2019t end up really supporting blockchain development. Moving forward, questions may revolve more around which sectors of the industry benefit over others.\n\nFor example, Congress is likely to pass a stablecoin bill no matter who wins the election. But under Harris, the bill may favor large banks, whereas under Trump, the bill may foster \u201centrepreneurial creativity,\u201d Hougan said.\n\nSimilarly, a Harris win may end up benefiting Ethereum at the expense of other smart contract platforms like Solana {{SOL}} or Avalanche {{AVAX}}, simply because these newer blockchains haven\u2019t cleared the same regulatory hurdles.\n\n\u201cCrypto will do well regardless of the outcome,\u201d Hougan said. \u201cLike, Bitcoin doesn't need Washington. It just needs Washington to get out of the way.\u201d",

    "content": "Ethereum Foundation researchers Dankrad Feist and Justin Drake have resigned from their advisory roles at EigenLayer, months after a controversy erupted over potential conflicts of interest within the Ethereum community.\n\nEigenLayer is one of the most prominent up-and-coming cryptocurrency projects, serving as a platform for crypto applications to \u201cborrow\u201d Ethereum\u2019s security through a novel concept called \u201crestaking.\u201d\n\nDrake and Feist are among the best-known researchers at the non-profit Ethereum Foundation, which is responsible for stewarding the development of Ethereum, the largest smart-contract blockchain and the second-largest overall behind Bitcoin.\n\nIn the spring, Drake and Feist publicly confirmed that they had each accepted advisory roles with EigenLayer. Each researcher was allotted a significant sum of EIGEN tokens in exchange for helping guide the upcoming project and its roadmap.\n\nThe controversy surrounding these payouts revealed deep divisions within the Ethereum community \u2014 and among some of its most prominent figures \u2014 regarding the industry\u2019s still-developing norms concerning conflicts of interest.\n\nOn Saturday, both of the researchers disclosed that they had relinquished their advisory roles with EigenLayer.\n\n\u201cWhile I believe that the role was negotiated in good faith and with the aim of making sure that EigenLayer is well aligned with Ethereum,\u201d Feist said in an X post, \u201cI understand that the perception of this relationship has been different and that for many the conflict of interest this creates is difficult to reconcile with my role as an Ethereum researcher.\u201d\n\n\"I want to apologize to the Ethereum community and EF colleagues for the drama I caused,\" Drake said in his own X post announcing that he had stepped down from his EigenLayer advisorship in September. \"In hindsight it was a bad move for me to make.\"\n\nIn a message to CoinDesk, Drake clarified that his advisorship was terminated before any of his EIGEN tokens had been vested.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation regularly awards grants to projects building atop the Ethereum ecosystem and has a major stake in the network\u2019s overall development.\n\nSome community members feared that EigenLayer\u2019s payouts to foundation researchers amounted to an attempt by the project to influence the broader Ethereum network\u2019s development roadmap.\n\nIn addition to stepping down from his EigenLayer advisory role, Drake took the added step of committing not to make investments or take advisory roles in the future.\n\n\u201cGoing forward I will turn down all advisorships, angel investments, and security councils,\u201d Drake said on X. \u201cThis personal policy goes above and beyond the recent EF-wide conflict of interest policy, not because that was asked of me but because I want to signal commitment to neutrality.\u201d",

    "headline": "\u2018It\u2019s So Early\u2019: How Solana Is Competing With Ethereum for Institutional Interest",
    "content": "Solana has garnered notoriety for its meme coin connection.\n\nBut financial institutions are also interested in using the network to build their products.\n\nWhile Solana is newer than Ethereum, it doesn\u2019t face the same challenges when it comes to transaction throughput and cheap fees.\n\nIt would be easy for a casual observer to think that the Solana network is for memecoins and Ethereum for financial institutions.\n\nWhile BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has preached the gospel of tokenization on Ethereum \u2014 his firm even launching a tokenized fund, BUIDL, on that blockchain \u2014 Solana has often made headlines this year thanks to the success of pump.fun, a protocol that allows users to create memecoins in minutes.\n\nThat, however, doesn\u2019t mean Ethereum has a monopoly on institutional interest, according to Hadley Stern, chief commercial officer at Marinade Finance, a Solana-based DeFi protocol that provides staking services for that blockchain's {{SOL}} token.\n\n\u201cOn the institutional side, it's so early,\u201d Stern, who was the founding president of Fidelity Digital Assets and global head of digital asset custody at BNY Mellon, told CoinDesk in an interview. \u201cWe could probably count on one hand the amount of TradFi products that are being built or have been built on Ethereum and Solana.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was brought on [Marinade] because there\u2019s a lot of product discovery around strong interest from institutions,\u201d Stern said. \u201cAsset managers, high net worth holders, individual holders, hedge funds \u2026 are interested in [staking on Solana].\u201d\n\nLaunched in March 2020, Solana and SOL exploded on the crypto scene during the 2021 bull market partially thanks to support from FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. SOL cratered when FTX collapsed, but staged a comeback in 2023 and, at $79 billion, is now the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nStern\u2019s assessment comes as financial giants such as Franklin Templeton, Citibank and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale all announced new Solana-based projects last September during Breakpoint, the network\u2019s biggest yearly conference. And he wasn\u2019t the only one electrified by such institutional enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cAt Breakpoint, it was eye-opening to see how many people are now building on Solana,\u201d Tristan Frizza, founder of Solana-based decentralized derivatives exchange Zeta Markets, told CoinDesk in an interview. \u201cInstitutions are doing pretty crazy stuff.\u201d\n\nSolana vs Ethereum\n\nAt first view, building on Ethereum can seem like a no-brainer for financial institutions. After all, it\u2019s the oldest and largest smart contract blockchain, it has the largest number of developers in the crypto ecosystem, it settles the majority of stablecoin transactions and it\u2019s the birthplace of DeFi. \u201cIf you work at a large bank and you're trying to tokenize an asset, you're not going to get fired for putting it on Ethereum,\u201d Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan recently told CoinDesk.\n\nBut Ethereum isn\u2019t risk-free, according to Leah Wald, CEO of Sol Strategies, a crypto holding company that also runs a large Solana validator.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty that continues around transaction fees certainly doesn't make anyone comfortable,\u201d Wald told CoinDesk in an interview. \u201cIf you're going to be if you're an institution, and you're thinking 10 years out, you can't be building on a blockchain that you're concerned about.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlackRock\u2019s BUIDL is based on Ethereum, and for what they're trying to build, I think that's perfectly fine,\u201d Wald added, but any kind of projects with high-volume transactions, like real-time payments or trading, might struggle. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about a more sophisticated on-chain fund, or a financial platform, then there's a real opportunity for Solana.\u201d\n\nIn other words, nothing currently guarantees that Ethereum\u2019s scalability strategy, which hinges on layer 2 blockchains, will pay off, and the transformations the network has undergone in the last few years \u2014 like its monetary policy change, or its transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake \u2014 show that Ethereum is still figuring itself out.\n\nSolana\u2019s cheap transactions and low throughput, by contrast, don\u2019t hinge on the accomplishment of a complex and technical roadmap. And that can make all the difference.\n\nWald noted, however, that in the U.S., Ethereum benefits from more regulatory clarity than Solana. The fact that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot ether exchange-traded funds this summer is likely a reassurance for institutions, even as inflows into those new funds have been disappointing. A spot SOL ETF might be years away, depending on the outcome of today's presidential election.\n\nA different mindset\n\nAnother point where Solana tends to be underestimated, Frizza said, is in terms of technical innovations. While Ethereum is famous for its army of developers, builders on Solana tend to fly under the radar, even when they come up with new tools and products that can have an impact on crypto ecosystems beyond their own.\n\n\u201cPeople underrate what Solana enables from a structural perspective \u2014 and also the mindset that Solana builders have,\u201d Frizza said. \u201cThey really care about users, the product, building things that scale and that address user needs.\u201d\n\nTo Frizza, that attitude means that, if another crypto mania occurs again, fascinating apps will come to light on Solana. Speaking of Zeta Markets, he said one priority was to \u201cbring down UX barriers and make it feel as easy as trading on Robinhood. That's when you can really start opening up the funnel and bringing a lot of people in.\u201d\n\nStern concurred. Memecoins aren\u2019t an innovation in themselves, he said, but the fact they were able to flourish on Solana in a way they couldn\u2019t on any other platform is a symptom of developers working at the highest level: pump.fun is simply taking advantage of a technical breakthrough. \u201cEthereum has a very hands-off relationship with an open source viewpoint, whereas I think the Solana Foundation does a better job from a business development standpoint,\u201d Stern said. \u201cSort of guiding the ship, but not in a completely controlling way, and letting a thousand flowers bloom.\u201d",

    "headline": "Is Optimism's 'Superchain' Winning the Ethereum Layer-2 Race?",
    "content": "Optimism, one of the major layer-2 networks, has managed to get a slew of clients and firms to deploy their own blockchains using its technology, known as the OP Stack.\n\nPart of the strategy to get new networks to use the technology is to give out large sums of OP tokens in the form of grants. Officials within the Optimism ecosystem say those tokens are supposed to help different projects kickstart their building on OP Stack.\n\nSome argue within the ecosystem it's too early to conclude whether OP Stack has won the layer-2 race.\n\nOne of the biggest trends of 2023 among the leading layer-2 projects on Ethereum was the emergence of \u201cblockchain in a box,\u201d where the teams encouraged developers to clone their code to spin up new layer 2s.\n\nNow, one project in particular appears to be pulling away as the clear leader. And as is often the case in blockchain development, a crucial factor is the money changing hands behind the scenes.\n\nOptimism, one of the major layer-2 networks, has managed to get a slew of clients and firms to deploy their own blockchains using Optimism\u2019s technology, with the OP Stack, under open-source software licenses.\n\nOptimism\u2019s first major client to come out of OP Stack was Coinbase\u2019s Base \u2014 last year. But in recent months, additional projects have broken toward the ecosystem, with Uniswap, Sony and Kraken all sharing plans to deploy new layer-2 networks using the OP Stack.\n\nIt's a crucial development in the evolution of the broader blockchain universe, since layer-2 networks stand at the heart of developers' efforts to make transactions faster and cheaper in the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum, while the second-largest blockchain after Bitcoin, is currently the leading smart-contracts network \u2014 meaning it can handle programs and support applications \u2014 and it has become the dominant home for decentralized exchanges and lending platforms. Layer-2 blockchains work like auxiliary networks atop Ethereum, providing a venue for transactions to be executed quickly and at a low cost, and then settled down to the base chain.\n\nPart of the Optimism Foundation's strategy to get new networks to use their technology is to give out large sums of OP tokens in the form of grants. Officials within the Optimism ecosystem claim that those tokens are supposed to help different projects kickstart their building on OP Stack while contributing to Optimism\u2019s Superchain, a network of OP chains that are connected amongst each other, as well as to Optimism\u2019s governance system, which is known as the Collective.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to reach critical mass \u2014 perhaps not unlike the ascendance in the 1980s of VHS over Betamax as the dominant videotape technology.\n\nKraken's OP token grant\n\nThe deal with Kraken came with a sizable grant, which included an allocation of 25 million OP tokens, worth about $42.5 million when CoinDesk broke the news recently. Kraken's network is called \u201cInk.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for World (the recently renamed Worldcoin project), Uniswap and Sony all declined to comment on how many tokens their projects received as part of their packages, but according to Kraken\u2019s Andrew Koller, the creator of Ink, other OP Stack participants also got sizable amounts.\n\nOptimism Foundation officials say they leave it up to the projects to disclose the amounts of their grants.\n\nIn an industry that prides itself on transparency, the unwillingness to share how many OP tokens are designated to those chains raises some questions on how big of a factor those grants played into those deals.\n\nA spokesperson with the Optimism Foundation shared with CoinDesk that the Optimism ecosystem has been transparent about their treasury, and that the Kraken deal falls under their \u201cpartnerships fund,\u201d which goes \u201cto certain projects to help support initial development of the chain.\u201d\n\nOptimism's Treasury and Grant Breakdown\n\nAccording to the data as of Sept. 30, there are about 841 million OP tokens designated towards that kind of funding, with just under 480 million OP tokens already committed. That works out to 361 million remaining, or nearly $480 million at the current OP token price of $1.32.\n\nSome smaller projects building layer 2s on the OP Stack have also received tokens. Celo\u2019s governance forum previously disclosed that it would receive up to 6.5 million OP tokens for building on OP Stack, and the Bitcoin-focused BOB project shared that it was still in the negotiating process, but at the time of writing the deal was for about 500,000 OP tokens.\n\nThe tokens designated to BOB come from a different grant bucket, given by the Grants Council, which is part of Optimism's DAO. This is separate from the Foundation, and projects looking to scale their projects can apply for these grants with the Council.\n\nChains can also apply for grants from the Retroactive Public Funding Goods (RPFG) bucket. As of Sept. 30, there\u2019s just shy of 860 million OP tokens under the RPGF bucket, \u201cwhich goes towards rewarding on-chain impact across Optimism, and the Superchain,\u201d according to a spokesperson at the Optimism Foundation.\n\nProjects like Kraken\u2019s Ink will also be eligible for RPGF funding.\n\nSo has Optimism ultimately won the layer-2 race, and does their grant strategy play into it?\n\nThe spokesperson at the Optimism Foundation told CoinDesk over email that, \u201cLike many ecosystems in the space, we view grants as ways to support projects and developers, and allocations are earned by achieving agreed-upon growth milestones that are ROI-positive for the whole Collective. We\u2019re all working together to scale the future of Ethereum and when teams in the Superchain are successful, it benefits the entire Ethereum community.\u201d ROI stands for return on investment.\n\nHas OP Stack Won The Layer-2 Race?\n\nOptimism Foundation\u2019s chief growth officer, Ryan Wyatt, told CoinDesk in an interview that \u201cthe adoption of OP Stack being the de facto choice for scaling L2s is starting to happen, which is exciting. Whether you want to call that winning or whatever, I don't know.\u201d\n\nThe OP token price has fallen a staggering 65% this year, based on pricing from the website DigitalCoinPrice. But that's less than the declines for other major layer-2 tokens, such as Polygon's MATIC, down 70% in 2024, and Arbitrum's ARB, which has slid 72%. Etherum's native cryptocurrency, ETH, is up about 6% year-to-date.\n\nWyatt added: \u201cWhether we're at a point where it's just a fact that if you're going to launch an L2, you're going to just go with OP Stack, I think it's too early to say. But if any large institutions, companies, are coming into this space, and they want to be an L2, I think you start orienting more like, \u2018Why would we not choose the OP Stack?\u2019\u201d\n\nCompetitors, like Offchain Labs, the main developer firm behind layer-2 Arbitrum, have taken a different approach in trying to get users to build with its technology.\n\n\u201cThere's a strategy that prioritizes announcements, and there's a strategy that prioritizes actually on-chain success and metrics,\u201d Steven Goldfeder, CEO of Offchain Labs, said to CoinDesk \u201cOur strategy is to empower real users and real builders, and build real technology that's empowering new interesting as well as established different use cases of technology.\u201d\n\nAs for Kraken\u2019s Ink decision to pick OP Stack, Koller told CoinDesk that the reasoning came down to \u201cwhat is going to allow me to spend the resources of engineering the most effectively,\" he said.\n\n\"Do I want to worry too much about security and the protocol upgrades, and having to manage that myself, or do I want to be able to use resources effectively and just make good UX, good tooling, and bring our clients on-chain and make the applications?\" Koller said. \"That's really what we cared about.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cLet's just focus on experience so we don't have to worry about the complexities of running a blockchain. I think that's why Optimism was a clear choice.\u201d\n\nRead more: Kraken Picked Optimism's 'Superchain' After Getting a Pile of OP Tokens\n\nCORRECTION (17:38 UTC): Corrects to show that BOB token grant came from Grants Council, not the RPGF.",

    "content": "Eclipse launched its long-awaited mainnet blockchain on Thursday \u2014 introducing a first-of-its-kind layer-2 network that melds tech from the popular Ethereum and Solana blockchains into a single package.\n\nLike other layer-2 Ethereum rollups, Eclipse lets people transact on Ethereum with faster speeds and lower fees. To accomplish this, it operates as its own network, written using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) \u2014 the fast and cheap execution architecture spearheaded by Ethereum's biggest competitor, Solana. Similar to other layer 2s, Eclipse bundles up transactions from its users and periodically passes them down to the base Ethereum chain, where they're cemented permanently to the chain's ledger.\n\n\u201cEclipse is uniquely positioned to bridge Ethereum and Solana ecosystems,\u201d Eclipse CEO Vijay Chetty said in a statement. \u201cThis platform empowers developers to scale their applications without forcing them to choose between two leading blockchain networks.\u201d\n\nThe SVM architecture allows Solana-native developers to write (or port over) decentralized applications (dApps) that could run faster and cost less than Ethereum-native apps.\n\nWhile Solana is prized for its speed and low cost of transactions, Ethereum is known for its security and deep liquidity. Users across Solana and Ethereum could benefit from this so-called modular setup: dApps on Eclipse can easily interoperate with native Solana apps, meaning the network can help connect liquidity from both ecosystems.\n\nAccording to the Eclipse Foundation, the Eclipse mainnet has already onboarded a number of projects, including DeFi platform Orca and consumer-focused Save and Nucleus. Altogether, the network will host more than 60 decentralized applications in finance, gaming and digital services.\n\nEclipse's cross-ecosystem approach has made it one of the most-hyped blockchain projects of this past cycle, allowing it to raise more than $50 million from investors.\n\nThe project's long road to launch has not been without controversy.\n\nNeel Somani, Eclipse Labs' co-founder and former CEO, was ousted from the company in May after sexual misconduct allegations against him surfaced on social media. No charges have been filed against Somani in connection to the allegations.\n\nFurther controversy followed in July when a CoinDesk investigation revealed that Somani had secretly allocated an outsize share of its forthcoming token supply to a partner at Polychain, its largest backer. Polychain told CoinDesk that the side deal between Eclipse and its partner was not properly disclosed and violated the fund's conflict of interest policies.\n\nA spokesperson for Eclipse told CoinDesk on Thursday that \"the token supply deal with a Polychain partner no longer exists.\"\n\nUPDATE (11/7/24 22:47 UTC): Adds comment from an Eclipse spokesperson regarding token allocation.",

To achieve this goal we must follow a conservative treasury management policy that ensures we have sufficient resources even in the case of a multi-year market downturn.\u201d\n\nSince the last snapshot in March 2022, when ETH was trading around $3,300, the price has slid 22% to roughly $2,600, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nThe foundation spent $105.4 million in 2022 and $134.9 million last year, it revealed.\n\nThe figures are consistent with statements made in September by foundation researcher Justin Drake, who shared in a Reddit AMA that the foundation spends about $100 million a year and holds $650 million in its main wallet. The foundation has roughly 10 years of runway, Drake said then.\n\nThe foundation also revealed it is implementing a new conflict of interest policy, emphasizing that researchers and developers must inform the organization if they plan to take on any additional outside work and whether they plan to invest in funds. If the outside work pays more than $25,000 annually, and if they want to make investments, these must be reviewed by a discussion group.\n\nPeople working at the foundation will not be allowed to take on outside work and get paid in illiquid assets with an unknown market value, including advisorship token packages before the launch of projects, the report emphasized.\n\nThe conflict-of-interest policy comes after two top Ethereum researchers, Drake and Dankrad Feist, revealed last week that they would be leaving their advisorship roles at EigenLayer, the giant restaking platform on Ethereum.\n\nTheir positions with the Eigen Foundation came with a significant token payout from EigenLayer, a fact that raised concerns of conflict of interests when the two developers disclosed their new roles in May.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Foundation's Main Wallet Down to About $650M, Top Official Says",

    "content": "The company behind the ENS blockchain domain service has cinched a plan to build its own layer-2 blockchain, dubbed \u201cNamechain.\u201d\n\nNamechain will be a zero-knowledge rollup, and will likely go live around the end of 2025.\n\nENS Labs, the company behind the Ethereum Name Service, is moving ahead with a plan to launch its own layer-2 network.\n\nNamechain, as the new network is called, should go live around the end of next year, ENS Labs' chief operating officer, Katherine Wu, told CoinDesk. It will use zero-knowledge rollups, a scaling technology that speeds blockchain transactions and reduces the cost of executing them by compressing the amount of data published on-chain.\n\n\u201cThis technology allows Namechain to process and execute transactions off of the main Ethereum network while still inheriting the full security of Ethereum, but at a fraction of the cost,\u201d ENS Labs said in a press release Monday.\n\nThe new network will leverage the infrastructure of an existing zero-knowledge chain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Wu said. The team is in the final stages of choosing which zkEVM it will use, she told CoinDesk by Telegram.\n\nENS is blockchain's answer to the web's domain name service. Just as domain names (Amazon.com, WhiteHouse.gov) are human-readable and easier to remember than numerical IP addresses, ENS names are more relatable than crypto wallet addresses. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin's ENS handle, for example, is Vitalik.eth, which rolls off the tongue better than his address (0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045, should you be wondering.)\n\nIn May, ENS Labs proposed overhauling the project's registry system by transforming it into an L2. At the time, it had not yet committed to the ZK rollup model.\n\nThe overhaul, ENSv2, will see a complete re-architecture of the ENS protocol, as well as its extension onto a layer-2, Wu said.\n\n\"The heavy technical lift here will be in making sure that Namechain is backward compatible with ENSv1 (the current set up on Ethereum mainnet) from day one of launch,\" Wu wrote. \"[To] a user, there should be no difference on the front end/user experience as we launch Namechain, except for lower gas fees.\"\n\nENS\u2019 decision to go ahead with ENSv2 follows a series of other announcements of major crypto firms coming out with their own layer-2 projects. Recently, teams behind decentralized finance project Uniswap, crypto exchange Kraken and Sony\u2019s Blockchain Labs unveiled plans to launch their own rollup networks. Instead of ZK rollups, however, those projects use layer-2 Optimism\u2019s technology, known as the OP Stack, which allows developers to clone its code to create their own blockchains.\n\n\u201cNamechain represents ENS' next evolution, and I'm excited for the huge improvements it will bring in scalability and cost, and the new applications it will enable,\u201d said ENS Labs' co-founder and lead developer, Nick Johnson, in the press release.\n\nRead more: Ethereum-Based Domain Protocol ENS Seeks Own L2, Possibly With ZK Rollups",

    "headline": "Top Ethereum Researcher's Dramatic Proposal Draws Standing-Room-Only Crowd in Bangkok",
    "content": "BANGKOK \u2014 It's been over two years since Ethereum's community last rallied behind a big tech event. That event\u2014the so-called Ethereum merge\u2014marked the network's long-awaited shift to a new, more eco-friendly consensus mechanism called \"proof-of-stake.\"\n\nThe core guts of the Ethereum blockchain have changed little since then. The chain's developers have pushed through a series of upgrades to enable the growth of quick and cheap \"layer-2\" blockchains, but the Ethereum community has mostly been starved of a single organizing vision\u2014at least one that commanded the level of enthusiasm generated by the Merge.\n\nThat might soon change.\n\nAt Ethereum's Devcon conference in Bangkok on Tuesday, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake revealed his proposal for a major redesign of Ethereum's consensus layer called \"Beam Chain.\"\n\nBeam Chain is \"a proposed redesign of the consensus layer that incorporates all of the latest and greatest ideas from the Ethereum roadmap,\" Drake said in a speech at Bangkok's Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre.\n\nDrake's Beam Chain vision organizes a series of \"big ticket\" upgrades to Ethereum's consensus layer into a single package. The changes include adjustments to Ethereum's block production apparatus, as well as how it handles staking and zero-knowledge cryptography.\n\nDrake's presentation was highly anticipated\u2014coming after months of speculation online and in crypto forums that the influential Ethereum researcher, who was instrumental to the 2022 Merge upgrade, was working on something major. Drake delivered his remarks to a packed convention hall, with onlookers spilling out into the hallway outside of the event's main stage.\n\nThe Beam Chain won't entail any immediate changes to Ethereum, or even anything radically different from what's already on the chain's roadmap. It does, however, propose a major change to how Ethereum's future upgrades are organized.\n\nToday, Ethereum upgrades its core code roughly once per year. Drake proposes continuing to make incremental upgrades to the chain each year to address \"low-hanging fruit,\" but then knocking out big changes in one fell swoop a few years from now.\n\nThe Beam Chain would focus on Ethereum's consensus layer, also called the Beacon Chain, which is the part of the network that handles how transactions get processed and recorded. \"The beacon chain is kind of old,\" Drake said. \"The spec was frozen five years ago, and in those five years so much has happened.\"\n\nAccording to Drake, the Ethereum developers today have a \"much better understanding\" of how to adapt to maximal extractable value\u2014strategies used by sophisticated traders to wring extra profit from Ethereum, sometimes at the cost of regular users. The past half-decade has also yielded valuable breakthroughs in zero knowledge technology, said Drake, and the Ethereum blockchain has built up \"technical debt\" that challenges developers' ability to develop the chain quickly and securely.\n\nAmong the focus areas for the Beam Chain will be \"faster slots\" and \"faster finality,\" meaning ramping the frequency with which blocks are added to the chain, as well as increasing the number of transactions included per-block. This could eventually mean the introduction of single slot finality, where blocks with transaction data can be finalized immediately, meaning that information would become permanent right away and impossible to alter.\n\nCurrently, it takes about 15 minutes on Ethereum for a block to finalize. By decreasing the finality time, the finalization process would become more efficient for applications or exchanges that have a high transaction throughput. Having that 15 minute delay creates opportunities for MEV to be extracted and raises the risk of reorgs.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns about centralization with faster finalization times, since there's more computing power needed, with expensive hardware. Developers will need to balance the tradeoff between shortening finalization times and computing power.\n\nThe Beam Chain also includes a proposal to bake zero-knowledge cryptography deeper into the fiber of Ethereum's base network.\n\nEthereum developers have embraced a roadmap involving layer-2 rollups, which are auxiliary blockchains atop Ethereum where transactions can be executed quickly and at a lower cost, and then settled down to the base chain.\n\nAs part of that, rollups have embraced a new type of technology that uses zero-knowledge proofs to help with the scaling of the blockchain. Over the last two years, dozens of ZK rollups have popped up, like Polygon\u2019s zkEVM and Matter Labs zkSync, initially driving a lot of the attention and building to these new blockchains.\n\nWith Drake\u2019s Beam Chain proposal, support for zero-knowledge proofs will be built into the main Ethereum layer-1 chain. It's therefore reasonable to wonder what implications this might hold for the fast-growing field of ZK-powered layer-2 networks.\n\nWhile the Beam chain would be an ambitious upgrade, Drake said in his talk on Tuesday that he was reluctant to call it \"Ethereum 3.0\" (people sometimes referred to Ethereum's 2022 Merge upgrade as \"Ethereum 2.0.\") \"The Beam Chain is only about the consensus chain,\" said Drake, while other research is still being done into Ethereum's execution and data layers\u2014the other core elements of the network that support things like apps and layer-2 data.",

    "headline": "Ethereum Developer Consensys Plots Token Issuance in Sign of Trump Thaw",
    "content": "Consensys, a leading Ethereum development firm, is ready to release a token for Linea, its layer-2 blockchain network.\n\nThe plan comes after Donald Trump's reelection has lifted a regulatory \"cloud\" over blockchain companies in the U.S.\n\nLINEA will be issued as rewards to active contributors and users of the rollup network, sometime in Q1.\n\nLinea, the rollup blockchain built by Ethereum development firm Consensys, is on the brink of releasing its \"LINEA\" token, the company told CoinDesk.\n\nConsensys was founded by Joe Lubin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, and is today best-known as the company behind MetaMask, the most popular Ethereum wallet. The Linea network was released last year and represents Consensys' attempt to compete with a growing fray of layer-2 networks \u2014 blockchains that help scale Ethereum by offering users an extra lane for transacting more quickly and cheaply.\n\nAccording to Texas-based Consensys, the LINEA token will be issued as rewards to active contributors to, and users of, the Linea network. The exact distribution criteria and timeline have yet to be disclosed, but Consensys said it expects to release LINEA sometime in the first quarter of next year.\n\nEthereum's layer-2 ecosystem has flourished over the past two years, with networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism and Base gradually outpacing the main Ethereum chain in terms of overall transaction volume.\n\nLinea sought to differentiate itself from many early rollup networks by centering itself around zero-knowledge technology\u2014a kind of cryptography that Ethereum developers expect to eventually become the dominant method for scaling the network. But its lack of a token has long been viewed as a disadvantage, as most other layer-2 platforms dangled the prospect of tokens in part as a way to attract users.\n\nRegulatory 'cloud' lifted\n\nThe LINEA announcement comes just after Donald Trump's re-election to the U.S. presidency. Consensys was one of the most closely watched U.S.-based blockchain companies during the Biden administration's crackdown on the industry.\n\nMetaMask is nearly ubiquitous among Ethereum users, and some feared that position would make Consensys a target of anti-crypto regulators looking for potential points of network centralization.\n\nThe incoming administration is widely expected to take a more favorable view of the crypto industry. Several teams at Ethereum's Devcon conference in Bangkok, where Consensys unveiled its plans for LINEA, told CoinDesk they were optimistic a second Trump administration would foster a friendlier environment for issuing tokens.\n\nLubin said the election did not play a role in Consensys' decision to finally announce LINEA, but he acknowledged that \"we've been operating under a cloud of uncertainty for a long time.\"\n\n\"To the extent that we were concerned that the SEC would come after us, years ago we stopped doing tokenizations,\" said Lubin.\n\nAn association and a DAO\n\nThe token marks a major step toward decentralizing the Linea ecosystem. It comes months after Consensys made a similar move to decentralize core components of its widely-used Infura data platform.\n\nAlong with the LINEA token, Consensys has announced the formation of the Linea Association, a non-profit tasked with distributing the token and stewarding development of the Linea protocol.\n\nFurthermore, \"there'll be a DAO [decentralized autonomous organization] and probably sub-DAOs to organize the work,\" Lubin told CoinDesk. \"It'll be lots and lots of tokens, a high percentage of tokens, dedicated to the community.\" Lubin would not specify how many tokens will be distributed to Linea's community or to other network stakeholders.\n\nThe DAO will eventually be able to award token grants to Linea contributors. \"As people land new innovations for Linea, land products and users and TVL [total value locked] on Linea, there will be programs to award those,\" said Lubin.\n\nAvoiding 'sybil' attacks\n\nWhile tokens have proven a reliable recruitment tool, they haven't always proven durable in the long run. Months after their public debuts, most of the tokens linked to Linea's layer-2 competitors have fallen sharply below their initial price levels.\n\nLubin said he is convinced that LINEA will fare more favorably than similar Layer-2 tokens. In part, this comes down to Linea's user-attestation system, which was designed to suss out individual humans to prevent any single person from spoofing the network across multiple different accounts, thereby accruing tokens to each of them via so-called \"sybil\" attacks.\n\n\"When we introduced Linea, very early on we introduced proof of humanity, and we put it as a main element of our point system,\" said Nicolas Liochon, the head of Linea at Consensys. \"Points\" refers to the internal scores that Linea uses to track who should receive LINEA tokens.\n\nOther tokens have \"allocated tokens to many Sybils who had no interest in being productive members of the ecosystem and dumped tokens,\" said Lubin. \"We believe we've taken effective and prudent steps to drastically minimize the number of Sybils that will receive LINEA.\"",

Those improvements, in theory, could lead to more transactions being conducted on the main Ethereum chain rather than auxiliary layer-twos, which in turn might conceivably mitigate the supply issue identified by Magadini. However, Beam Chain could take years to see the light of day, if it does at all.\n\nIrrespective of Ethereum's fundamentals, however, a potential acceleration in bitcoin's uptrend could eventually drag ETH above $4,000, while maintaining its underperformance relative to BTC.\n\nUPDATE (Nov. 19, 2024, 16:38 UTC): Adds context about Beam Chain proposal in penultimate paragraph.",

Frequency is already one of the largest parachains in the Polkadot environment, and the plan is to add other blockchains as the non-profit organization looks to expand its reach to a wider user base.\n\nProject Liberty says it wants to reduce consumer reliance on monolithic social media companies, such as Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) and Meta's (META) Facebook. User dissatisfaction has already led to an exodus from X, including to Meta's alternative called Threads. Many have flocked to Bluesky, which is set up as a public benefit corporation and embraces decentralization principles that echo Project Liberty's, following the U.S. election two weeks ago. Bluesky has added 1 million accounts on some days and this week crossed the 20 million user threshold.\n\n\"We all know how the network effect works, and when you own so many relationships and so many people in your walled garden, you have a privilege versus everyone else,\" McCourt said in an interview. \"By opening up and creating this universal social graph that's accessible by everyone, where individuals control their stuff, you then have the network effect embedded in the internet.\"\n\nThe scope of Project Liberty's vision is wider and deeper than just tackling some of the more prominent abuses found in social media, however. According to the company, it's about building a fairer internet, devoid of walled gardens and surveillance capitalism, closely aligning the project with Web3, a concept originally espoused by technologists like Consensys chief Joe Lubin.\n\n\"This is a transformative moment, in my opinion,\" McCourt said. \"We're meeting the zeitgeist where it is with something that's been extremely well engineered and thoughtfully done with a massive amount of time and money invested in it. We need an internet where we're not eventually clicking on the terms and conditions of use of apps, but the apps are clicking on our terms and conditions of use for our data.\"\n\nOver five years in the making and with some $500 million backing it, Project Liberty says it's \"population-scale\" ready. Interoperability is the key to realizing this goal and is inevitable, McCourt said, recalling a telecommunications company called RCN that his family started back in the early 1990s, which foresaw the harmonization among large incumbent telcos that happened later in the decade.\n\nPeople will look back in 10 years and find it absurd that you had to be on Facebook to talk to someone on Facebook, McCourt said.\n\n\"I think when people are empowered, they're going to move fast,\" McCourt said.\n\nThe Project Liberty Summit on the Future of the Internet takes place this week in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 21-22.",

    "headline": "Ethereum Layer-2 Teams Welcome Proposal to Overhaul Blockchain",
    "content": "What's good for the L1 is good for the L2s.\n\nThat's the assessment the teams behind zkSync and Polygon, two of the leading layer-2 networks running on top of Ethereum, gave of a recent proposal to overhaul the $400 billion blockchain, dismissing suggestions it would make their auxiliary networks redundant.\n\nLast week, at the biennial Devcon gathering in Bangkok, Thailand, developer Justin Drake laid out an ambitious plan to revamp Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer architecture. As part of that plan, which has come to be known as the \u201cBeam Chain,\" Drake suggested incorporating zero-knowledge cryptography, which several L2s use to compress data in order to make transactions faster and cheaper, into the Ethereum protocol.\n\nOver the past few years, many in the Ethereum ecosystem have pushed a rollup-centric roadmap, meaning they would rely on layer-2 networks to overcome Ethereum\u2019s scaling challenges. Zero-knowledge rollups specifically were seen as the superior technology because they have advantages over so-called optimistic rollups in terms of speed and security.\n\nAhead of Drake\u2019s Devcon talk, many were left wondering what the Beam Chain would mean for the zero-knowledge rollups on Ethereum, and whether they would become obsolete.\n\n\u201cThat's really a misconception,\u201d said Alex Gluchowski, the CEO of Matter Labs, the developer firm behind zkSync. \u201cThe changes that Justin announced are focused on the consensus layer, not on the execution layer. It's not going to affect the execution layer.\u201d\n\nEthereum, the base layer, is itself made up of several layers. The consensus layer is responsible for ensuring that blocks are validated, while the execution layer is in charge of executing transactions. Layer-2s, which post their transaction data back to Ethereum, are mostly affected by changes on the execution layer.\n\nIn addition to incorporating ZK, Drake's proposal seeks to shorten block times, which could cut transaction costs for L2s settling on Ethereum. Drake also said he wants to introduce single-slot finality, meaning blocks with transaction data could be finalized immediately, and that information would become permanent right away. If all goes as envisioned, the Beam Chain would go live in 2029 (although Ethereum has a history of delaying ambitious technical upgrades.)\n\n\u201cAll of those things are great because we depend on Ethereum as the global settlement layer,\u201d Gluchowski said.\n\nGlow-Up for Rollups?\n\nBrendan Farmer, a co-founder at Polygon, also told CoinDesk he doesn\u2019t think the Beam Chain would obsolesce layer-2s. Instead, he said, the upgrade would \u201cmake rollups work better.\u201d\n\n\u201cShorter block times, faster finality, ZK verifiability of what's happening on the consensus layer \u2013 those are things that I think have a really positive impact for L2 usability and for L2 interoperability between different ecosystems,\u201d Farmer said.\n\nFaster finality on Ethereum would be especially useful for making layer-2s interoperable, a widely shared goal for scaling networks.\n\n\u201cA big problem with Ethereum right now is that for a block to be considered finalized, it generally takes 12 to 19 minutes,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cIf you're moving funds between like Arbitrum and Polygon: until that transaction has been withdrawn from Arbitrum and deposited to Polygon, Polygon can't safely credit those funds to a user until that transaction has been finalized on the L1. So that just leads to a bad user-experience, whereas if you have 12-second finality, that becomes a better user experience.\u201d\n\nGluchowski of Matter Labs called the Beam Chain a vindication of zero-knowledge proofs as a scaling method.\n\n\u201cUsing ZK really emphasizes the fact that ZK is the end game,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: Top Ethereum Researcher's Dramatic Proposal Draws Standing-Room-Only Crowd in Bangkok",

    "content": "Starknet has become the first major layer-2 blockchain running on top of Ethereum to let users earn money by staking their tokens and validating transactions.\n\n\n\nThe feature is intended to help decentralize the auxiliary network and has been in the works for a while. Starknet\u2019s main developer firm, StarkWare, formally proposed the change to the community in July.\n\n\n\nNow, anyone who has at least 20,000 STRK tokens (roughly $12,000 at recent prices) can pledge the asset as collateral and earn rewards for validating transactions. Users with less than 20,000 STRK can delegate their tokens to validators to stake on their behalf. (Validators that behave maliciously or neglect their duties stand to forfeit staked tokens.)\n\n\n\nValidators and delegators that want to withdraw staked tokens must wait 21 days to receive them as well as any rewards earned from staking.\n\n\n\nStarknet is following in the footsteps of the main Ethereum chain, which completed a long transition to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt took Ethereum three years to get this right. It\u2019s also going to take us time, but Starknet will be the first major L2 to take these steps toward decentralization,\u201d said Eli Ben-Sasson, the CEO and co-founder of StarkWare, in a press release shared with CoinDesk.\n\n\n\nIn April 2024, Metis, a much smaller layer-2 network, added staking to its ecosystem.  However, the contract where Metis tokens are locked sits on the main Ethereum chain, though users can stake them on the L2 through a liquid staking protocol \u2014 which bridges back to the mainnet.

    "headline": "Ethereum Blob Usage Explodes as Traders Rush to Layer 2 Solutions",
    "content": "Ethereum is witnessing a surge in \"blob\" usage, an effective data management tool introduced earlier this year, signaling that more users are embracing layer-2 scaling solutions for faster and more affordable transactions.\n\nThe number of blobs or binary large objects posted to Ethereum has consistently averaged more than 21,000 this month, matching the record activity seen in March, according to pseudonymous data analyst Hildobby's Dune Analytics dashboard.\n\nEthereum's Dencun upgrade, which went live earlier this year, introduced blobs, which attach large data chunks to regular transactions, storing data offchain without congesting the mainnet, unlike call data which is stored permanently. Think of blobs as a consolidated large box filled with letters while paying for an entire box instead of call data, which is akin to paying for each letter posted separately.\n\nThe spike in the number of Blobs posted points to increased adoption of layer-2 protocols such as BASE, Arbitrum, Optimism and others. These protocols use blobs to bundle transactions together, process them off-chain and then post them to the Ethereum main chain for verification.\n\n\"Transactions for ETH and its L2s are continuing to reach all-time highs, now +40% vs. the Summer. Meanwhile, the average blob count has increased ~20% driving L2's Blob Fees to a 30-day high,\" Matthew Siegel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, said on X.\n\nBlobspace is a dedicated area within Ethereum's blocks where layer 2s temporarily post their data, but it comes with a cost, depending on network conditions. Note that these blob fees paid in Ethereum's native token ether are burned just as transaction fees, taking out the cryptocurrency's circulating supply from the market. This contradicts the popular narrative that layer-2 protocols are predatory to the mainchain.\n\nThe blob base submission fee spiked as high as $80 on Monday, the highest since March, and the average number of blobs posted in each ethereum block rose to 4.3. More importantly, blob fees have burned over 166 ETH worth $560,000 in the past seven days, the ninth largest, according to ultrasound.money.\n\n\"Blob fees have historically been very low since the implementation of blobs in EIP4844 as they have their own fee market which has largely not seen price discovery. Recently, as onchain activity has begun to spike, demand for blobspace on the L1 has increased, and the blob fee market has entered price discovery,\" Artemis said in the newsletter. \n\nThe data suggests potential ether outperformance ahead. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose to a four-month high of $3,546 Monday, outperforming bitcoin's 5% drop, but has since pulled back to $3,370, CoinDesk data show. ",

    "content": "Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap-up of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I'm Marc Hochstein, CoinDesk's deputy editor-in-chief for features, opinion and standards.\n\nIN THIS ISSUE:\n\nEthereum's blob mob\n\nStaking on Starknet\n\nAvalanche's big upgrade\n\nL2 teams beam over Beam Chain\n\nSui suffers a brief outage\n\nBitcoin bridged, trustlessly\n\nThis article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.\n\nNetwork news\n\nBEAMING OVER THE BEAM CHAIN: What's good for the L1 is good for the L2s. That's the assessment the teams behind zkSync and Polygon, two of the leading layer-2 networks running on top of Ethereum, gave of Justin Drake's proposal to overhaul the $400 billion blockchain, dismissing suggestions it would make their auxiliary networks redundant. \u201cThat's really a misconception,\u201d said Alex Gluchowski, the CEO of Matter Labs, the developer firm behind zkSync. \u201cThe changes that Justin announced are focused on the consensus layer, not on the execution layer. It's not going to affect the execution layer.\u201d In addition to incorporating ZK, Drake's proposal seeks to shorten block times, which could cut transaction costs for L2s settling on Ethereum. Drake also said he wants to introduce single-slot finality, meaning blocks with transaction data could be finalized immediately, and that information would become permanent right away. \u201cAll of those things are great because we depend on Ethereum as the global settlement layer,\u201d Gluchowski said. Brendan Farmer, a co-founder at Polygon, also told CoinDesk he doesn\u2019t think the Beam Chain would obsolesce layer-2s. Instead, he said, the upgrade would \u201cmake rollups work better.\u201d However, others in the crypto community were underwhelmed by the whole plan, lamenting in particular that Drake\u2019s five-year timeline wasn\u2019t ambitious enough, leaving ample room for centrally-developed chains like Solana to eat Ethereum\u2019s lunch.\u201d Read more\n\nSUI OUTAGE: Sui Network (SUI), a relatively new blockchain, experienced an unexpected two-hour outage on Thursday. The downtime was caused by a bug in its transaction scheduling logic, which led to its validator network crashing. The issue was resolved, the network said. Blockchain outages can take place for a plethora of reasons, ranging from a 51% attack to technical errors. A common error is that of nodes - or individual entities that process transactions - being unable to sync with each other, causing the blockchain to go offline. Software bugs may be another error vector, where outdated code can render the network's processes inoperable. Read more\n\nSTAKING ON STARKNET: Starknet has become the first major rollup blockchain running on top of Ethereum to let users earn money by staking their tokens and validating transactions. (Metis was the first layer-2 to do so but is far smaller and is an \"optimium,\" a different kind of L2.) Now, anyone who has at least 20,000 STRK tokens (roughly $12,000 at recent prices) can pledge the asset as collateral and earn rewards for validating transactions. Users with less than 20,000 STRK can delegate their tokens to validators to stake on their behalf. (Validators that behave maliciously or neglect their duties stand to forfeit staked tokens.) Validators and delegators that want to withdraw staked tokens must wait 21 days to receive them as well as any rewards earned from staking. Implementing staking on Starknet is part of a multiphase plan. During this first phase, StarkWare, the company developing Starknet will study staking habits on the network, and from there will assess whether and how its validators can be given the additional responsibilities of creating and \"attesting,\" or confirming, blocks in the protocol. Read more\n\nAVALANCHE'S BIG UPGRADE: Avalanche, the eighth-largest blockchain by total value locked (TVL), is moving ahead with a major technical makeover. The Avalanche9000 upgrade went live in a test network environment Monday, bringing the changes one step closer to the main network. Avalanche9000 will be the largest upgrade that Avalanche has seen. It is designed to cut the costs of sending transactions, operating validators and building apps on the network, whose native token (AVAX) is the 11th-largest cryptocurrency, with a $16 billion market cap. The foundation is trying to attract developers to Avalanche and encourage users to create customized blockchains using its technology, known as subnets. Somewhat confusingly, subnets are now officially referred to in the Avalanche community as \"L1s,\" even though they are roughly analogous to the layer-2, or L2, networks that augment Ethereum and other blockchains. (Avalanche's \"primary network,\" the equivalent of a layer-1 in other ecosystems, is considered a subnet.) The team is hoping to bring Avalanche9000 to mainnet by yearend. Among other changes, 9000 would allow for a new type of validator with which anyone can launch their own subnets. Read more\n\nONE-WAY TICKET: BitcoinOS, a smart contract project led by crypto O.G. Edan Yago, has executed what it bills as the first trustless bridge transaction for any blockchain. Using zero-knowledge cryptography, a nominal amount of bitcoin (0.0002 BTC, about $19 and change) was locked up on the main blockchain's testnet, and a proof was generated minting tokens on the testnet for Merlin Chain, a layer-2 network. No oracle or custodian was involved, according to BitcoinOS. For now, however, Merlin Chain is like the Hotel California or a roach motel for the bridged BTC. \"This is one half of the bridge showing the ability to bridge assets from Bitcoin to an EVM,\" BitcoinOS said in a press release. \"Once the other half of the bridge is completed, Merlin Chain users can settle their Bitcoin-pegged assets back to the mainchain by proving that the tokens were burned.\"\n\nEthereum's Blob Mob\n\nUsage of binary large objects, or blobs, has surged on the Ethereum network, signaling that more users are embracing layer-2 scaling tech for faster and more affordable transactions.\n\nThis year, Ethereum's Dencun upgrade introduced blobs, which allow large chunks of data to be temporarily attached to transactions, and later deleted after the data is verified. (You can think of a blob as a sidecar that rides along with a motorcycle for a time but eventually gets detached and discarded.) Layer-2 protocols such as BASE, Arbitrum, and Optimism use blobs to bundle transactions together, process them off-chain and then post them to the Ethereum main chain for verification without permanently gumming up the works.\n\nThe number of blobs posted to the network consistently averaged more than 21,000 this month, matching the record activity seen in March, according to pseudonymous data analyst Hildobby's Dune Analytics dashboard.\n\nPosting blobs costs a fee, which fluctuates depending on network conditions. The fees are paid in Ethereum's native token ether, and are burned just like regular transaction fees, taking supply of ETH off the market, a positive for the coin's price.\n\nIn this way, blobs mitigate the much-discussed cannibalization of the main chain by L2.\n\nThe blob base submission fee spiked as high as $80 on Monday, the highest since March, and the average number of blobs posted in each Ethereum block rose to 4.3. More importantly, blob fees have burned over 214 ETH worth $723,000 over the last seven days, the sixth largest source of fee burns on the network over that period, according to data from ultrasound.money.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ANALYSIS BY COINDESK'S OMKAR GODBOLE\n\nMoney Center\n\nVibe shift\n\nCoinbase App Gets Left Behind as Memecoin Craze Drives Traders On-Chain\n\nNot just fun and games?\n\nWhy Memecoins Matter\n\nBringing in the big Sun\n\nTrump's Sluggish DeFi Project Gets a Big Boost From Justin Sun's $30M Token Purchase\n\nJustin Sun Joins Donald Trump's World Liberty Financial as Adviser\n\n\"Reports are greatly exaggerated\"\n\nThink Ethereum\u2019s ETH is Dead?

    "content": "A streak of inflows into U.S.-listed spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), rising activity on the Ethereum blockchain and increased institutional trading interest could help the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap surpass its three-year-old price record in the coming months.\n\n\u201cETH spot ETFs continue to record strong net inflows, totaling $90.1 million yesterday and marking a 4-day winning streak,\"  QCP Capital said in a note referring to Wednesday trading. \"Despite this week's retracement, these healthy inflows highlight the market's growing optimism. ETH was the main outperformer Wednesday as it rallied 11.65% to a high of 3,688. This is aligned with our thesis of capital rotation from BTC to ETH.\"\n\nThe ether ETFs attracted over $220 million in the Nov. 22-27 period, data shows, the second-longest streak of inflows since they went live in July.

BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) led, attracting $250 million and $79 million in fresh funds, respectively.\n\nFriday was the fifth consecutive session with net inflows for the group, and concluded the second strongest week with $455 million in net inflows, per SoSoValue data. It was a shorter week as U.S. traditional markets were closed on Thanksgiving Thursday.\n\nEther ETFs also outpaced flows into their spot bitcoin counterparts, which gathered $320 million inflows on Friday and suffered net outflows during the week.\n\nAfter falling out of investors' favor and lagging behind bitcoin in price action and ETF flows this year, ether has enjoyed a resurgence recently as Donald Trump's election victory rejuvenated interest in altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nAlong with strong ETF inflows, open interest for ETF futures on the institutional-focused Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) surged to all-time records of almost $3 billion, per CoinGlass, underscoring the improving sentiment towards the asset.\n\nRead more: Think Ethereum\u2019s ETH is Dead?

    "content": "The Ethereum blockchain's transactional revenue has increased substantially since Donald Trump's U.S. election victory, Steno Research said in a Monday report.\n\n\"This outcome is crucial for all onchain activity,\" wrote analyst Mads Eberhardt.\n\nThe surge has led to higher staking rewards and more ether (ETH) being burned via transaction fees, the report said.\n\n\"This combination strengthen's Ethereum's tokenomics,\" Steno said, making ether a more appealing asset.\n\nSteno noted that the amount of USDT on the Ethereum network surpassed supply on the Tron blockchain for the first time in more than two years. This is a clear sign that on-chain activity is booming, resulting in greater demand for ether to facilitate transactions and higher transactional revenue.\n\nThe number of daily transactions on Ethereum layer-2 networks, or rollups, is also growing, and Steno said it expects this upward trend to continue.\n\nRollups are Ethereum protocols that process transactions separately from the main network to help increase speed and lower costs. Layer 2s are separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s, or the base layer, that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data.\n\nThe daily fees the rollups pay to Ethereum are not transformative at the moment, but Steno said it is not unrealistic to estimate that they could reach $1 million, and when this happens it will be a meaningful addition to the network's economics.\n\nEther spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. recorded their largest one-day net inflow to date on Friday, and surpassed bitcoin (BTC) versions for the first time, the report noted.\n\nRead more: Ether's Risk-Reward Is Attractive, Bernstein Says",

    "headline": "Ethereum's Justin Drake Sees No Threat From Solana, Says Its \u2018Golden Era\u2019 Will End",
    "content": "Ethereum developer Justin Drake said his comprehensive proposal to overhaul the second-largest blockchain's consensus layer isn't about catching up with a rival, it's about sticking around for the long haul.\n\nDrake unveiled the proposal, known as the Beam Chain, at Ethereum's biennial Devcon gathering in Bangkok last month, at a time when the network's native token ETH is lagging behind its counterparts at other major layer-1 blockchains.\n\nThe Ethereum network enjoyed wide adoption over the last few years, making it more expensive and slower to use. In response, a cohort of layer-1s, known as \u201cEthereum killers,\u201d emerged in 2020 to compete with Ethereum on transaction speeds, and Solana has been seen as the leader of the pack.\n\nRecently, activity on Solana has exploded, mainly thanks to the surge of memecoins on the blockchain, with users wondering whether it will overtake Ethereum as the \u201chot\u201d chain.\n\nBut Drake said he doesn\u2019t see Solana as a threat to Ethereum. Neither does he see the Beam Chain as a way to restore Ethereum\u2019s edge in the short term.\n\nThe Beam Chain \u201cis all about improving the long-term health and security of the consensus layer, it has nothing to do with performance,\u201d Drake said in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\n\u201cSolana has no consideration for health. The only thing they care about is performance. They care about reducing latency and increasing throughput,\u201d Drake added.\n\nEthereum has tried to address the scalability challenge, by pushing forward a rollup-centric roadmap, meaning users can transact faster and more cheaply on a bunch of auxiliary networks, known as layer-2s or rollups. Popular layer-2s on top of Ethereum include Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and ZKsync.\n\nEthereum developers have heavily relied on the layer-2s to offer faster and lower transaction fees.\n\n\u201cI think the layer-1 is competing with Bitcoin, and the layer-2s are competing with Solana. And so it's not even part of the remit of the layer-1 to even compete with Solana,\" Drake said. \"We should be competing on security and health. And so if there's any competition to Solana, it needs to come from the applications and from the layer-2s.\u201d\n\nArbitrum for example, has a slot time, or time between blocks of transactions being published to the chain, of 250 milliseconds. \"That is faster than Solana,\u201d Drake said. (According to a recent research report from Galaxy Digital, \"Solana targets slot times of 400 milliseconds, though they typically range from 500-600ms in practice.\")\n\nDrake did add, though, that there are some features for Ethereum's layer-1 that developers have worked on that will make Ethereum more competitive on speed with Solana. \n\nThe main ones are \u201cpre-confirmations,\u201d which speed up the confirmation of transactions and are supposed to make the user experience on Ethereum as smooth as Solana's, as well as \u201cblobs,\u201d a feature that allows Ethereum to process large batches of transaction data off-chain. But these are all separate from the Beam Chain, which Drake has said he is hoping to implement by 2029.\n\nAnd while Solana is seeing a lot of momentum, Drake said he is tuning out the noise to focus on long-term gains for Ethereum.\n\n\u201cSolana is having its moment right now, but I think it's going to be the end of the Solana golden era, because all of the competitive advantages that Solana has around latency and throughput are going to melt away because of fundamental differences in architecture that don't make it scalable,\u201d Drake said.\n\nA Solana spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment by press time.\n\nUltimately Drake said, his North Star is to create an \u201cinternet of value,\u201d and the Beam Chain is what he thinks is needed to achieve that.\n\n\u201cWe need a super-secure, incredibly neutral layer-1 and then we need a very rich and vibrant ecosystem of layer-2s that bring the application to the users,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: Top Ethereum Researcher's Dramatic Proposal Draws Standing-Room-Only Crowd",

    "content": "The price of Ethereum's ether (ETH) broke above the $4,000 mark on Friday for the first time since March.\n\nThe second-largest cryptocurrency is up 2.4% in the last 24 hours and 8.4% in the last seven days, outperforming bitcoin (BTC) in both timeframes. The move comes as spot ether exchange-traded funds saw record inflows on Thursday.\n\nAs of writing, ether is trading for $4,033, just 2% away from setting a fresh 2024 high. It's also a mere 20% away from its all-time high of $4,868. The ETH/BTC ratio, which has been getting hammered since September 2022, has reached 0.04 again \u2014 a level that marked a brief top for ether in relation to bitcoin on Nov. 10.\n\nThe Coinbase premium on ether also continues to expand \u2014 meaning that ether is trading for a higher price on the exchange than on the most liquid crypto exchange, Binance. Coinbase premiums are generally seen as a sign of demand among U.S. institutional investors as well as retail participants. TradingView data shows a slight increase in ether's price on Coinbase relative to Binance, suggesting the market is driven by activity from the U.S,., which coincided with the U.S. market opening around an hour ago.\n\nThat's not all. Glassnode data shows that active addresses on Ethereum have shot up on a 7-day moving average from 368,000 to 523,000 from Sept. 24 to Dec. 5, indicating an expansion of on-chain activity, which in turn ends up benefitting ether by constraining its the token\u2019s supply through the \"burn\" mechanism.\n\nMeanwhile, the CoinDesk 20 \u2014 an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization excluding memecoins, stablecoins and exchange coins \u2014 is down 1.4%, with its worst performers consisting of stellar (XLM) and litecoin (LTC), which have dropped 3.1% and 5% respectively in the last 24 hours.

    "headline": "Dev's Defection Highlights Ethereum's Growing Solana Problem ",
    "content": "Ethereum's place near the top of the crypto market is unquestioned from the perspective of market cap. But beneath the surface \u2013 at the product, developer and decision-making levels \u2013 the original smart contracts platform continues to take a beating from Solana, one of its closest competitors.\n\nThe threat may not yet be existential. Ethereum and its many closely-linked networks are still the most important, influential, and largest platforms for decentralized finance. That lead is beginning to erode, however, with many newcomers to crypto choosing Solana's speed and low fees.\n\nIt's enough for some of Ethereum's most vocal backers to muse if the network needs to shift to a war footing.\n\n\"Ethereum has been at peacetime its entire life,\" ETH maximalist David Hoffman said on a recent episode of his podcast, Bankless. \"Today, more people are thinking this period of Ethereum's life has come to an end.\"\n\nThe dynamic was further punctuated Monday with news that longtime Ethereum ecosystem developer Max Resnick was moving into Solana's orbit, abandoning his job at the developer studio Consensys.\n\n\"There's just so much more possibility and potential energy in Solana,\" Resnick said in an interview with CoinDesk. He framed the decision as rooted in his own career path, but noted \"frustration\" with Ethereum's inability to adapt contributed to the move.\n\nHe criticized a culture of ossification that gets in the way of progress. Ethereum lacks a streamlined process for making quick changes. Some see that as a point of strength for a decentralized network, while others, like Resnick, see it as a hindrance for long-term success.\n\nSpeed of an iceberg\n\nEthereum is rather notorious for being a somewhat unwieldy technical beast of a network. Its developer community looks toward co-founder Vitalik Buterin's annual \"roadmaps\" as a benchmark in tracking Ethereum's sluggish march of progress. A number of important changes may still be years away.\n\nWhile Ethereum's decision-making may not be as purposely disjointed and ineffective as Bitcoin's, the network still contends with an unhealthy degree of internal politics, said Resnick. Big, important discussions over improving the network \"are happening in Vitalik's DMs,\" he said.\n\n\"If you do need to make rapid changes to keep up with competition, which I think Ethereum has to for the first time now, then you are really going to need to change that process up somehow.\"\n\nIt was enough to prompt Resnick to search for a new home, and to land at Solana. He took a job at Anza, a spinoff of Solana Labs that is charged with building its core client. He said he's a fan of Solana's ability to move fast in the face of competition.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), Dankard Feist, an Ethereum Foundation researcher, commended Resnick for \"finally opening the Overton window to speak about stuff that isn't perfect in Ethereum land. ... In the long term, we need to build a good product, can't do that without open criticism.\"\n\n\nOff the iceberg\n\nOne startling moment in the brewing fight between Solana and Ethereum came last week from Pudgy Penguins, one of the best-known NFT collections on Ethereum. The team behind Pudgy Penguins is launching a token, called PENGU, but doing so on the Solana network, not on the NFTs' home of Ethereum.\n\nThe shock announcement spurred plenty of hand wringing on crypto twitter.\n\nAt the least, commentators took the decision as evidence of Solana's superiority as a retail-friendly chain when compared to Ethereum. Many other ETH-native projects have sidestepped main-chain woes without leaving Ethereum entirely. They build on layer-2 networks that are built on top of Ethereum.

    "content": "Investor demand, onchain metrics and network activity are setting up ether (ETH) to reach a $5,000 level for the first time, CryptoQuant analysts said in a report.\n\n\n\nEther spot ETFs posted a 13-day inflow streak on Wednesday to reach nearly $2 billion in cumulative net inflows. The funds attracted their first billion from July to early December, but SoSoValue data shows that they needed only five trading days to capture the next billion.\n\n\n\nTotal daily transactions hovered around the 6.5 million to 7.5 million level in the past few months, compared to about 5 million through 2023, indicative of higher network activity.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the total supply of ETH has reached its highest level since April 2023, but the amount of ETH burned via fees has been growing since September. The total supply of ETH has reached 120 million, marking the highest level since April 2023.\n\n\n\nBurns refers to permanently removing tokens from circulating supply by sending them to a wallet that no one controls. As the network sees higher activity and demand, the burn rate increases, limiting the growth of ETH supply and creating deflationary pressure.\n\n\n\nHigher network activity on Ethereum signifies increased usage and demand for the network's capabilities, reflecting the growing adoption of decentralized applications. Moreover, it leads to greater ETH burned via transaction fees, which can create deflationary pressure on the total ETH supply, as the burn rate can outpace issuance during periods of high activity.\n\n\n\nThese factors cumulatively set up ETH to retake its all-time highs from 2021 and beyond.\n\n\n\n\u201cETH could be heading above $5k if current demand and supply dynamics continue,\u201d CryptoQuant said. \u201cAccording to ETH\u2019s realized price\u2014the average price at which holders purchased their ETH\u2014the current upper limit for ETH\u2019s price stands around $5.2k.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis upper limit marked the top for ETH in the 2021 bull run. However, as new market participants buy ETH at higher prices, this upper price band continues to rise,\u201d they added.\n\n\n\nThe recent surge in Ethereum's price has significantly increased the total value of assets locked within its ecosystem, reaching $77 billion on Thursday, the highest level since January 2022.\n\n\n\nThe lion's share of these assets is managed by just three key applications: Lido, which dominates with over $38 billion in staked ether, making it the largest liquid staking protocol; Aave, with $19 billion spread across various assets, functioning as a lending platform; and EigenLayer, a restaking platform, holding $18 billion.\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum network has witnessed a notable uptick in several key metrics in November. There's been an increase in revenue, transaction fees, new wallet creations, and on-chain volume, all indicating heightened activity when compared to the quieter months from May to September, as a CoinDesk analysis previously noted.\n\n\n\nEther largely underperformed bitcoin and other major tokens since 2022 but saw a return in bullish sentiment after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential elections in November, rekindling hopes for a DeFi bull run among investors.\n\n\n\nTrump's campaign has signaled a potential softening of regulatory pressures on cryptocurrencies, which could ease operations for DeFi platforms within the country. This anticipation has been a catalyst for increased demand for ETH and has propelled the growth of major DeFi tokens since early November.",

    "content": "ENS Labs, the company behind the Ethereum Name Service, said Tuesday that it picked Linea's technology to build its upcoming layer-2 network, Namechain.\n\n\n\nLinea is a zero-knowledge rollup that came out in July 2023 and was built by Ethereum infrastructure giant Consensys. It is the seventh-largest rollup network, according to L2Beat, with $1 billion locked in its ecosystem.\n\n\n\nENS Labs said it picked Linea to build its network for two reasons. \"One is sort of values alignment,\u201d said Nick Johnson, the founder and lead developer of ENS. The other has to do with speed.\n\n\n\nRollups are a special type of blockchain where one can transact faster and at a lower cost. There are two kinds of rollups: optimistic and zero-knowledge. Optimistic rollups use optimistic proofs, which have a seven-day window to dispute transactions before they are finalized (proofs are assumed to be \"optimistic\" that no one will dispute their contents). Zero-knowledge rollups, by contrast, use zero-knowledge cryptography, seen by many as a superior technology, to secure proofs and finalize those proofs within minutes.\n\n\n\nENS has been described as \"the phone book for Web3,\" but a more precise analogy is the web's domain name service (DNS). The domain name \"CoinDesk.com\" is easier to remember and type than a numerical IP address. Similarly, ENS handles like parishilton.eth, which the namesake heiress acquired in 2021, are more relatable than the strings of letters and numbers that make up Ethereum wallet addresses.\n\n\n\nFor this service, \"we need fast finality,\u201d Johnson said. That's because \u201cyou want to be able to update your ENS name and have the chain reflect it in the smallest interval possible. And to do that and have it remain decentralized and secure, we need fast finality, and optimistic roll-ups can't deliver that,\" Johnson said.\n\n\n\nThe news comes as other major crypto projects announce their intentions to roll out layer-2 networks, though unlike ENS, some of the biggest names in blockchain have tapped Optimism\u2019s OP Stack to build out their networks.\n\n\n\nENS will be one of the first major projects to build out a layer-2 blockchain based on Linea's technology (Linea is also building a layer-2 network for blockchain wallet application Status.)\n\n\n\nThe team behind Linea said last month that it plans to issue a Linea token. Both Johnson and Nicolas Liochon, the founder of Linea, told CoinDesk that there are no concrete plans yet for how that token would be used in the Namechain ecosystem.\n\n\n\nLiochon said having the Namechain team working on the Linea stack will help strengthen and decentralize the L2 protocol.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe really want to have multiple organizations contributing to Linea, and we work on having more organizations too, as a way to make [the network] more secure,\u201d he said. \u201cSo really, we want to have multiple teams so there's no centralization point.\u201d\n\nRead more: Ethereum's ENS Identity System Set to Launch Own Layer-2 Blockchain",

    "content": "Ethereum's developers have finally delivered a timeline for the chain's next big upgrade, Pectra, which promises to introduce an array of speed and efficiency improvements to the second-largest blockchain. At a developer meeting held virtually on Thursday, Ethereum's core team set the upgrade's target release date for March 2025.\n\n\n\nPectra combines together eight major upgrades, or \"Ethereum improvement proposals\" (EIPs), into one package.\n\n\n\nAmong the most anticipated upgrades is EIP-7702, aimed at improving the user-experience of wallets. The upgrade, which was reportedly sketched out by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in a mere 22 minutes, enables user wallets to be programmed like smart contracts. It's part of a broader strategy to bring account abstraction to Ethereum \u2014 a series of features that make setting up and using wallets a lot less clunky.\n\n\n\nAnother highly-anticipated upgrade, EIP-7251, increases the maximum amount validators can stake from 32 to 2,048 ETH. The change addresses a massive nuisance faced by the validators who stake ETH to keep the chain running today: Those who want to invest more than 32 ETH with the network must split their stake between dozens \u2014 or sometimes, hundreds \u2014 of separate nodes. This isn't just burdensome. It has also resulted in weeks-long lines for setting up new nodes.\n\n\nPectra was originally on track to be Ethereum\u2019s biggest hard fork to date, and it's the first major improvement to the chain since 2024's Dencun upgrade. A blockchain hard fork is a particularly major kind of software upgrade that, in essence, moves a network over to an entirely new chain.\n\n\n\nWhile still significant, the upgrades included in Pectra are stripped-down from some earlier plans. Developers decided in September that earlier plans for Pectra were too ambitious, and they agreed to split the original package into two.\n\n\n\nDevelopers plan to test Pectra on Ethereum's Sepolia and Holesky test networks throughout February. If all goes well, developers will proceed to bring Pectra to mainnet in early or mid-March.\n\n\n\nRead more: Ethereum Developers Confirm Plan to Split 'Pectra' Upgrade In Two",

    "headline": "Ethereum L2s Are About to Hit a Brick Wall: Polynomial Protocol Founder",
    "content": "Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions may soon hit their limits in efficiently scaling the mainnet, warns Gautham Santhosh, co-founder of Polynomial.fi.\n\nLayer 2 solutions are protocols or networks built on top of a layer-1 networks to improve its scalability and reduce transaction costs by processing transactions off-chain and then periodically settling the results on the main chain. More and more users have embraced these protocols for faster and more affordable transactions late last year.\n\nThat's evident from the spike in the number of blobs or binary large objects posted by hundreds of L2s to Ethereum. Since November, the daily tally has averaged a record 21,000, according to pseudonymous data analyst\u00a0Hildobby's Dune Analytics dashboard.\n\nHere is the concerning part. Just two Layer 2s \u2013 Coinbase's BASE and World Chain \u2013 account for 55% of the daily blog activity. So, a sustained demand for Layer 2s could quickly deplete available capacity.\n\n\"Ethereum L2s are about to hit a brick wall. 55% of all blob space is already consumed by just 2 chains. And at current growth rates, we're only months away from everything breaking,\" Santhosh said on X.\n\nBlobs are like regular transactions with an extra piece of transaction data attached. However, unlike traditional transactions, blob-carrying transactions do not permanently occupy the mainnet space and are only available for 18 days. Layer 2 protocols use blobs to bundle transactions, process them off-chain, and post them to the main chain for verification.\n\nThe blob limit per block is six, with a target of three. When the target is reached, a base fee is charged to regulate demand from L2s.\n\nSince November, the demand for blobs has been so high that the target of three has consistently been met. In other words, scores of L2s are competing for the per-block target, driving base fees higher.\n\n\"It's like having a highway with only 3 lanes for 50 growing cities,\" Santhosh said.\n\nThe chart shows the base submission fee has been markedly higher since November compared to preceding months, occasionally topping the $50 mark.\n\nThese typically spike during market hours, airdrops and when a new layer 2 solution goes live, leading to higher user costs. \"This is hitting everyone. DEXs seeing higher trade costs, perp protocols facing base fee spikes, users paying more for basic transactions,\" Santosh explained. \"At @polynomialFi, our base fees are up 300% in recent months.\"\n\nAccording to pseudonymous Base builder Jesse.base.eth, the spike in the blob base fee is hampering L2 growth.\n\n\"You can see this in the cyclical price spikes driven by daily demand cycles. We need more blobs ASAP to help all L2s continue scaling and ensure @ethereum is center of onchain,\" Jesse said on X.\n\nEthereum's Pectra upgrade, slated for March 2025, is expected to raise the blob limit per block to nine, with a target of 6. But, according to Santhosh, doubling capacity \"only buys us months, not years.\"",

    "content": "It's been a rough year for the Ethereum Foundation, the grant-giving nonprofit that helps support Ethereum, the best-known blockchain behind Bitcoin. As Ethereum loses market cap and mindshare to competitors, the foundation has been beset by scandal. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder and chief figurehead, has laid out a new plan to right the ship.\n\n\n\n\"We are indeed currently in the process of large changes to EF leadership structure, which has been ongoing for close to a year,\" Buterin said in an X post. \"Some of this has already been executed on and made public, and some is still in progress.\"\n\n\n\nIn his X post outlining the changes, Buterin listed a series of goals, including improving the \"technical expertise within EF leadership\" and improving \"two-way communications and ties between EF leadership and the ecosystem actors\" that it supports.\n\n\n\nAccording to Buterin, the changes won't be designed to centralize, corporatize or politicize the foundation. The organization won't suddenly \"[s]tart aggressively lobbying regulators and powerful political figures,\" he said, nor would it \"[b]ecome an arena for vested interests [...] or even more of a 'main character' within Ethereum.\"\n\n\n\nThe shake-up comes as Ethereum's reputation among builders has soured in recent months. Members of the broader crypto community are flocking to fast and cheap competitors like Solana, which has been quicker to accommodate the recent memecoin fervor.\n\n\n\nSome say Ethereum has lagged because it lacks an organizing vision \u2014 something the foundation, while not \"in charge\" of Ethereum, might have helped remedy.\n\n\n\nOver the past 12 months, the foundation has been mired in controversy. It has weathered accusations of being ineffectual, yet also too powerful. Conflict-of-interest scandals haven't helped, either: Payments from private companies to foundation employees recently sparked wide backlash and forced the organization to update its policies.\n\n\n\nSome have blamed Aya Miyaguchi, the foundation's executive director since 2018, for the foundation's woes. Amid a pressure campaign for Miyaguchi's removal, Buterin has stepped in as the Ethereum Foundation's sole decision-maker. \"The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me,\" he stated on X. \"One of the goals of the ongoing reform is to give the EF a 'proper board', but until that happens it's me.\"\n\n\n\nMiyaguchi, however, has not been ousted from the foundation. Buterin lambasted some of her critics on X, accusing them of using her as a \"scapegoat.\" In multiple tweets, Buterin highlighted certain particularly inflammatory social media comments \u2014 including death threats and explicit calls for more bullying of Miyaguchi \u2014 and called them \"pure evil.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you 'keep the pressure on', then you are creating an environment that is actively toxic to top talent,\" Buterin wrote. \"Some of Ethereum's best devs have been messaging me recently, expressing their disgust with the social media environment that people like you are creating. YOU ARE MAKING MY JOB HARDER.\"",

    "headline": "The Ethereum Foundation Has Lost Its Way",
    "content": "The Ethereum Foundation is a paradox. Despite its commitment to decentralization, it operates as a centralized entity, with a director, a treasury, paid developers, and an inner circle. These structures, while necessary for coordination, create tensions with Ethereum's decentralized ethos.\n\n\n\nThe Foundation Today\n\n\n\nIt is not widely known, but the current foundation was constructed in a less than ideal way. The previous director, Ming, was ousted in a coordinated effort by a group of people who have never been publicly identified or held accountable for it. I spoke with Ming days before her removal and she assured me she had no intent of leaving. I was later given information about who was responsible for her removal, but was not given much insight as to why. I have heard that Ming was a bit of a micromanager, and that she had an intensity that rubbed some people the wrong way. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s truth to that, but these stories are often window dressing for deeper truths.\n\n\nI can infer some good-faith reasons based on the way the org has been run over the past seven years. A very important role of the organization is to protect against internal power struggles as well as external capture. These are noble goals and ones they seem to have accomplished effectively.\n\n\n\nAnother major focus seems to have been minimizing the public footprint of the organization and constructing it in such a way that it would not draw the ire of governments who might hold them accountable if the political winds shifted against them. But as political winds shift, and the marketplace provides alternatives, the organization itself must adapt, both in form and function.\n\nEthereum was in its birth a visionary project, not simply technological in nature. It pointed towards a possibility of previously unimaginable futures through the empowerment of the individual to do what had previously taken billions of dollars, thousands of people, or millions of man hours to accomplish.\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation, in its current incarnation, designed to minimize threats both internal and external, has lost that vision.\n\nLead with Vision\n\nEthereum\u2019s next phase demands more than just technical research and coordinating conferences. It requires visionary leadership \u2014 someone who understands not just the technology but its broader social, philosophical, and political implications. This leader must inspire a new generation of builders, connect technology with human needs, and navigate the complexities of the political landscape without compromising Ethereum\u2019s ethos.\n\nRead more: Sam Kessler - Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Goes On Offense Amid Major Leadership Shake-up\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum whitepaper was not just a technical document; it was a beacon that allowed like-minded people to come together under a shared vision. In the face of chaos, uncertainty, and frequent conflicts, it served as a guiding light. What ensured our collective success was not the absence of challenges but the clarity of the mountaintop we were striving toward. This common vision allowed us to stay aligned even when disagreements and setbacks arose.\n\nIt was an idea whose time had come\u2014a blueprint that transcended the individuals behind it and inspired a community to persevere, innovate, and ultimately bring that vision to life. Without it, the project could have easily unraveled under the weight of its ambition.\n\n\n\nBe Transparent, Focus More on the Community\n\n\n\nTransparency is equally critical. Over the past few years, the Foundation has retreated into the shadows, leaving the community feeling disconnected. But ethereum would have been nothing without its community, and it will be nothing if it loses it. A community must be managed, curated, and cared for. It requires the onboarding of new people, with new energy, and new ideas, bound by a common vision. This also includes the teams who build on ethereum.\n\n\n\nSeize the Moment\n\n\n\nFrom a legal perspective, Ethereum must embrace the opportunity to engage with lawmakers. The current American political climate is uniquely favorable, and inaction now risks losing momentum. America has elected a President who not only owns ether, but has himself launched a lending protocol on top of it. As of now, we are inhabiting a political landscape which was unthinkable even a year ago, when Democrats surprised so many of us by openly declaring war on crypto, and the future seemed uncertain. There has never been a better time than now to ensure that the promise of crypto is realized.\n\n\n\nWhile maintaining political neutrality, the Foundation can create or promote frameworks that encourage compliance and innovation. Without these frameworks, the crypto space has been plagued by speculative ventures\u2014ICOs, DAOs, NFTs\u2014that skirt regulations rather than working within them to build sustainable use cases.\n\n\n\nLead by Example\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation should also consider utilizing its own technology to coordinate its operations and demonstrate the transformative potential of decentralized systems. By adopting Ethereum-based tools and protocols, the Foundation could potentially manage governance, treasury disbursements, decision-making processes, and community engagement.\n\nThis approach would not only demonstrate Ethereum\u2019s capabilities but also reinforce trust within the community by embodying the principles of decentralization and transparency that the project champions. Additionally, leveraging Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem for coordination could serve as a real-world case study, inspiring developers and organizations to explore similar solutions. By integrating its technology into its own operations, the Foundation would highlight the real-world utility of the platform while setting a precedent for how decentralized systems can effectively manage complex organizations.\n\n\n\nBe Accountable, Build the Future\n\n\n\nFinally, financial accountability must become a priority.\n\nWith $100 million spent annually, the Foundation should deliver measurable outcomes. Despite significant investment in technical research, user experience in crypto remains stagnant. Improving UX, UI, key management, and other security and usability problems isn\u2019t insurmountable but has been severely neglected. This oversight reflects a blind spot which must be addressed before wider adoption is possible.\n\n\n\nEthereum began as more than just a technological project\u2014it was a visionary movement for empowering individuals to achieve what once required massive resources. That vision is at risk of being lost. To reignite it, the Foundation must embrace transparency, invest in leadership, engage the community, and step into the legal and political spotlight.\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s story is one of triumph over chaos, and a testament to the power of collective vision. To ensure its future, the Ethereum Foundation must transform itself from a reactive institution into a proactive visionary force. For ethereum. For the community. For the greater good. For the future.\n\n\n\nWith Love,\n\nTexture\n\n\n",

The company framed the acquisition as a strategic move to enhance governance within the broader Ethereum ecosystem, citing expectations of renewed growth in decentralized governance due to President Trump's promise of regulatory clarity for the blockchain industry. \"2025 is the year we make good governance the standard for all protocols in Ethereum,\" Agora co-founder Yitong Zhang told CoinDesk. Agora was founded in 2022 by Zhang, Charlie Feng, and Kent Fenwick. The trio initially started working on governance tooling at Nouns DAO, one of the buzzier blockchain protocols to emerge from 2021's DAO and NFT hype cycle. Agora was founded on the premise that token governance is central to the value of crypto protocols. It aims to provide user-friendly, open-source governance tools for DAOs like Uniswap and Optimism, which both currently use Agora to organize token holders and hold governance votes.Boardroom, which predated Agora and has similar goals, took a more horizontal approach to blockchain governance. Boardroom has gradually transitioned from an Agora-style DAO tooling software to a data feed \u2014 similar to a \"Bloomberg\" for crypto governance data. Agora declined to disclose how much it paid to acquire Boardroom. Boardroom's employees have been offered roles at Agora, and Boardroom's founder, Kevin Nielsen, will remain as an advisor. \"There's no plan to deprecate\" Boardroom, according to Zhang. Rather, the Agora team will keep both platforms running and will work with users to determine how the tools might gradually be integrated.

Over the past several days, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined plans for a major restructuring of the Ethereum Foundation (EF), the nonprofit organization responsible for supporting Ethereum\u2019s development. In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Buterin shared details of the reorganization, which he said would streamline decision-making processes and address inefficiencies. The announcement has sparked criticism, with some arguing that Buterin\u2019s central role in the restructuring process undermines Ethereum\u2019s ethos of decentralization. The EF has long been scrutinized for its own centralizing influence. Over the past year, the organization has faced mounting pressure to define a clearer vision for Ethereum\u2019s future as competing networks like Solana make strides.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Hermetica has secured the liquidity, which it says will make it the largest stablecoin on Stacks, through collaboration with Bitcoin lending protocol Zest. The two plan to offer yield on USDh through lending against sBTC, the bitcoin-backed bridging asset that users can use to put their bitcoin wealth in the Stacks ecosystem. The initial liquidity boost could create a short-term window of higher yields, Hermetica said, with projections of an annual percentage yield (APY) as high as 50%. It currently provides an average APY of 18%, Hermetica said in an emailed announcement on Wednesday. Stablecoins play an integral role in the crypto economy, giving users a means of holding their assets in a token that isn't prone to such significant ebbs and flows in value, because they are pegged to a fiat currency (usually the U.S. dollar). Provision for stablecoins therefore would naturally be an important development in Bitcoin's evolution into a network that can support DeFi capabilities, a trend that has gathered momentum in the last couple of years. It should be pointed that, however, that the $3 million in liquidity that USDh provides is tiny compared to the dominant stablecoins in crypto. USDT and USDC have market caps of over $138 billion and $51 billion respectively, highlighting the relative infancy of the Bitcoin DeFi sector.

    "content": "The SSV DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization behind the decentralized staking protocol SSV Network, unveiled Tuesday a new framework, called \u201cSSV 2.0\u201d, which will allow applications to make use of \u201cbased\u201d technology by leveraging Ethereum validators.\n\n\n\nSSV 2.0 will be the most ambitious project for the SSV Network, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk, and will bring based applications (bApps) to Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\u201cBased\u201d applications, especially \u201cbased rollups,\u201d are a new type of technology attracting the attention of Ethereum developers as it allows for better interoperability while improving the security of networks on top of Ethereum.\n\n\n\nBased rollups specifically can be seen as a solution to the many layer-2 networks on Ethereum today, which have caused much fragmentation across the space. By leveraging \u201cbased\u201d technology, those protocols or applications can \u201cbase\u201d their security and execution operations off of Ethereum\u2019s layer-1 validator set.\n\n\n\nCurrently, layer-2 networks use \u201csequencers\u201d to order transactions and post those back to Ethereum. The issue with sequencers today is that they remain to be a centralizing component and can be a single point of failure. By using the validators from the layer-1 to do the execution and security work, networks can avoid the downfalls of using centralized sequencers.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum developers agree that based rollups allow for better interoperability in the network. Ethereum ecosystem members have gathered over the last few weeks to find ways to solve this issue, and based rollups are seen as a major breakthrough for that.\n\n\n\nNow the SSV Network will also tackle these issues by bringing applications with based technology to Ethereum. According to the SSV team, bApps gain \u201csecurity directly from the L1 instead of utilizing different tokens like in current restaking models, making them more Ethereum-aligned and not exposing Ethereum or its validators to cascading risks.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs part of that, the DAO is suggesting to turn the SSV Network into a bApp. \u201cTransforming the SSV Network from a DVT-powered staking infrastructure into a multidimensional network for the based economy will necessitate an evolution of SSV tokenomics,\u201d the team shared. (DVT, or distributed validator technology, refers to a type of tech that allows an Ethereum validator to run on multiple nodes simultaneously.)\n\n\n\n\u201cThis announcement marks a transformative leap for bootstrapping Ethereum security, addressing the growing demand for Layer 1 (L1)-anchored interoperable solutions - as seen with base sequencing and based validator commitments - amid increasing ecosystem fragmentation,\u201d the SSV team said in the press release.\n\n\n\nRead more: SSV DAO Starts $50M Fund to Push Ethereum's Decentralization Plan",

    "headline": "Ethereum\u2019s New Cheerleader on Wall Street: A Q&A With Vivek Raman",
    "content": "Ethereum is facing an identity crisis. Its native token, ether (ETH), is underperforming against competitors, and longtime builders are beginning to question whether the chain's technology is falling behind\u2014and if its community is losing focus.\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation, the nonprofit that stewards Ethereum's development, has been blamed for many of the network's struggles. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin is spearheading a massive leadership shake-up at the organization, but his central influence over the process has sparked its own controversy. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, rival ecosystems like Solana are capitalizing on the uncertainty, attracting top talent and outpacing ETH in the market.\n\n\n\nAmid this turbulence, a new project, Etherealize, is aiming to bring ETH to Wall Street. Founded by former banker Vivek Raman, Etherealize seeks to bridge the gap between traditional finance and Ethereum, positioning ETH as a serious asset class.\n\n\nRaman, who spent a decade in banking before discovering crypto, believes his traditional finance background gives him a unique perspective. He has spent the past four years laying the groundwork for Etherealize, choosing to launch in January\u2014a time of heightened market optimism driven by expectations of a crypto-friendly White House, even as Ethereum grapples with internal disputes and price stagnation.\n\n\n\nIn a recent interview with CoinDesk, Raman discussed his vision for ETH and the broader crypto landscape, including:\n\n\u2022\tHis journey into Ethereum and the founding of Etherealize.\n\n\u2022\tHow Etherealize is marketing ETH to Wall Street.\n\n\u2022\tThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s role and banks\u2019 views on layer-2 rollups.\n\n\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\n\n\nYou've had all this experience in traditional finance, and you call yourself a newcomer to the Ethereum world. Walk me through how you got into crypto, what was that moment?\n\n\n\nRaman: I was a trader at four banks, trading the most archaic, esoteric products\u2014high-yield bonds, distressed bonds, leveraged loans and credit default swaps and stuff. These are all the backbone of the economy, but I saw how inefficient they are.\n\n\n\nWhen you watch the movie Wall Street, and you see everything traded on the phone, you're like, \u201cOh, maybe the system's upgraded,\u201d But it hasn't. It still trades like that.\n\n\n\nI saw that for 10 years. I lived it. And I'm very lucky because I built a really good network, I have all these amazing mentors, all these people that ran banks and ran desks.\n\n\n\nBut after 10 years, the technological pace of Wall Street was not evolving at all, and I was like, \"Let me find something else.\"\n\n\n\nRight when I left Wall Street, I went to Austin, Texas, and I serendipitously met some of the Ethereum core developers on the research and development team. They were working on the Merge, and they taught me about Ethereum.\n\n\n\nWhile I was on Wall Street, it was very anti-crypto because of the regulators. The \"adoption moment\" wasn't even close for the 10 years I was there. But when I found Ethereum, I realized that this was the answer for Wall Street.\n\n\n\nThere are different components to Etherealize, right? Where does the \"marketing\" part come in?\n\n\n\nRaman: So it's three interrelated things.\n\n\n\nThe first thing is that everyone uses Ethereum; Ethereum is the most-adopted smart contract platform. Bitcoiners just talk about bitcoins\u2014probably because there's not much utility, so all you can do is talk about it.\n\n\n\nIt's almost like with Ethereum, there's so much utility that no one actually talks about the ETH asset. But the asset is very important to the ecosystem; for better or worse, people use the asset as a proxy for ecosystem health. Part of the reason why I think Solana has so much of the limelight isn't because it's necessarily the best technology; it's because the token went up a lot.\n\n\n\nSo the first thing is to talk about ether as an asset \u2014 as a portfolio diversifier, as something that's complementary to bitcoin \u2014 and to provide that content, research and marketing to ETF issuers, to the broader public and to institutions.\n\n\n\nThe second is that Ethereum is obviously a utility platform. It's this new financial internet; they call it \"the operating system for the financial economy.\" So we teach about Ethereum as a platform and what you can do with it: You can tokenize assets. You can build layer-2 ecosystems, where banks can actually have their own networksand can customize them to bring their customers on-chain.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd then, third, we actually try to give a call to action. The call to action is to tokenize assets on Ethereum or build a layer 2 on Ethereum, and we're building a product suite to actually facilitate Wall Street trading on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\n\nEthereum is experiencing an identity crisis. Its price is lagging far behind other cryptocurrencies, the Ethereum Foundation is undergoing a shake-up, and crypto community members are voicing their disagreements about Vitalik Buterin's central role in the ecosystem. Etherealize is coming to fruition at a moment when the ecosystem probably needs a marketing or advocacy arm. Is Wall Street the savior for Ethereum?\n\n\n\nRaman: I don't think it's a silver bullet. The Ethereum Foundation shouldn't have to do everything, and Vitalik shouldn't have to do everything. Research and development \u2014 and the high-level, cutting-edge strategy and roadmap to future-proof Ethereum for the next 100 years \u2014 that's Vitalik's job.\n\n\n\nWhose role is it to talk about these ecosystems? It's the application layer. It\u2019s institutions like Etherealize.\n\n\n\nThe problem is that once the Overton window shifted from regulatory attacks to regulatory acceptance, the other layer-1 ecosystems, which have very centralized and centrally planned companies behind them, picked up mind share and marketing market share. But ultimately, the best of the best is Vitalik \u2014 the best of the best is the EF researchers.\n\n\n\nI spent years developing this business plan, figuring out when the right time to strike was. I got a sign-off from Vitalik and the EF\u2014they gave us a small grant to get us started last August. But I did a lot of due diligence. I surveyed many institutions and asked if this was the moment. And it was.\n\n\n\nYou've discussed the role of the Ethereum Foundation (EF). Some believe the foundation is in charge of running the ecosystem. How do you divide the roles between the EF and Etherealize?\n\n\n\nRaman: The EF has great marketing people \u2014 there's just a lot to do.\n\n\n\nWe have this whole ecosystem of layer-2s that need coordination. One of the people in the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s leadership always says, \u201cEthereum doesn't have one business development arm, it has thousands of business development arms,\" which are all the apps, the layer 2s, etc.\n\n\n\nWe're here to act as a conduit to all the different apps and layer twos. And we have access to people who actually want to use Ethereum: the Wall Street players and institutions.\n\n\n\nWe go back and forth [with the EF] all the time. We have the best relationship with them, but we are arm's length from them. I view all this as a very positive sum.\n\n\n\nYou bring up layer-2 networks. How does Wall Street view them? We know that Deutsche Bank is launching a layer-2 on ZKsync, and UBS has also expressed interest in using layer-2 technology. But what\u2019s their view from what you\u2019ve seen?\n\n\n\nRaman:  I think it's going to be very ironic when people look back at criticisms for layer twos as being value extractive and dilutive. I think Wall Street views the layer twos as an opportunity.\n\n\n\nOne of many reasons I think Ethereum will win over other layer-1s is because it doubled down on the layer-2 roadmap and realized that the whole world doesn't belong on one uniform chain.\n\n\n\nThere are different companies, different countries and different states. Everyone has their own culture. You can't stuff it all in one place with one set of rules.\n\n\n\nWall Street views this as an opportunity. Where's the place where you can make the most money deploying assets and applications? It's on layer 2. At the app layer, you can control your level of customization and privacy. On layer 2, you can have know-your-customer (KYC) features. All that stuff is going to be extremely critical.\n\n\n\nWhy has Wall Street been holding back \u2014 was it really purely just the regulatory clarity aspect, which has changed now that there\u2019s a new administration in Washington?\n\n\n\nRaman: I think regulatory clarity is the right answer, but maybe it's a little too simplistic.\n\n\n\nI think the real issue is that there was no economic incentive for Wall Street institutions to actually use blockchains. Many of them viewed blockchains as competing or threatening. There was no way to make money using blockchains, especially with an oppressive regulatory regime.\n\n\n\nWith the shift in regulations and the expansion of technology like layer-2s, Wall Street can now make a lot of money using blockchains\u2014specifically on Ethereum, by building layer-2s and running assets on them. They can make a lot of money now, and so they're all rushing in. It\u2019s because they smell opportunity.\n\n\n\nRead more: Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Goes on Offense Amid Major Leadership Shake-up\n\n",

Since the upgrade, the proof-of-stake blockchain's usage fees known as gas have averaged roughly 75% less than in the months beforehand, data from Flipside and Bitquery show. The number of transactions has increased by 38% to an average of 354,691 a day. Avalanche, the world's fifth-largest smart-contract blockchain by the market value of its native token AVAX, boasts of a multichain structure of C-Chain, which handles smart contracts, P-Chain for managing staking and validator coordination and X-Chain for processing asset transfers. The upgrade comprised seven improvement proposals, including ACP-125, which lowered the base fee to run smart contracts on the C-Chain to 1 nAVAX from 25 nAVAX. One nAVAX is a billionth of an AVAX. The upgrade also replaced the hefty validator fee of 2,000 AVAX with a monthly subscription of 1 to 10 AVAX, opening doors for projects of all sizes to introduce layer 1 (L1) protocols on Avalanche.The goal of the upgrade was to make every component of the Avalanche tech stack cheaper by reducing C-Chain fees and removing capital requirements for L1 validators, Stephen Buttolph, Ava Labs' chief protocol architect, told Decrypt in November.

The simulation, which was conducted on a ZKsync test network, is a sign of renewed interest in blockchain technology among traditional financial institutions. This isn\u2019t UBS\u2019 first experiment with blockchain. The bank previously launched a tokenized money market investment fund, uMint, which is also built on Ethereum. UBS\u2019 Key4 Gold is one of the bank's offerings that lets its Swiss clients purchase a direct claim to physical gold. \u201cIt allows for fractional gold investments with real-time pricing, deep liquidity, secure physical storage, and optional physical delivery,\u201d the team said in a press release shared with CoinDesk. The project already exists on the bank's private blockchain, the UBS Gold Network, but the team was looking for ways to scale its project while preserving its privacy. \u201cThey came to the conclusion that only zero-knowledge made sense for them, and so they wanted to really put this in practice for a product that they already have live and what this could look like if they use the validium instead,\u201d Pearl Imbach, a Senior Business Development Manager at Matter Labs, the main developer firm behind ZKsync, told CoinDesk in an interview. ZKsync is a zero-knowledge rollup, a type of layer 2 scaling system that aims to increase the speed of blockchain transactions and reduce their fees, by using zero-knowledge cryptography. A validum is a different type of layer-2, similar to that of a rollup, but stores the data of those transactions off-chain. The test transaction may signal that UBS could be looking more closely at using layer-2 technologies to power some of its activities. However, the bank didn't say whether they would come out with their own layer-2, and Matter Labs' Imbach told CoinDesk that a rollup might not be the right fit for them. \u201cIs this the right product [for UBS]? Perhaps not, but it is something we're just talking openly about, and thinking about what could actually be a good use case for them,\u201d Imbach told CoinDesk.

    "headline": "How To Fix Ethereum's Fragmentation Problem ",
    "content": "The Ethereum ecosystem stands at a pivotal moment. Over the past four years, scaling challenges have been addressed through Layer-2 (L2) solutions, rollups, and technological breakthroughs, expanding from processing 15 transactions per second to thousands, with costs dropping from $50 per swap to mere cents. The rollup-centric roadmap worked \u2013 it worked almost too well.\n\n\n\nThis success has introduced an unexpected challenge: fragmentation. With over 50 L2s and more in development, Ethereum has become a maze of isolated chains. Users now juggle multiple networks, bridge assets, and navigate complex processes to perform basic actions.\n\n\n\nThe irony? Transactions may be faster and cheaper, but the overall user experience sucks!\n\n\n\nThe Cost of Fragmentation\n\n\n\nFragmentation is more than a minor inconvenience \u2013 it\u2019s becoming an existential threat to Ethereum\u2019s future. Users face the daunting tasks of managing multiple networks, bridging assets, and executing intricate processes. A simple action, such as buying a token, may require switching networks, bridging assets, and multiple transactions. Each step introduces friction, confusion, and opportunities for error.\n\n\n\nThe impact on liquidity is even more severe. Capital becomes trapped in silos, reducing market efficiency and increasing costs for all participants. DeFi protocols struggle to maintain deep liquidity across multiple chains, forcing users into worse prices or convoluted multi-step processes.\n\n\n\nFor developers, the situation is equally challenging. Choosing which L2s to support, managing multiple deployments, and building complex bridging infrastructure stifles innovation and raises barriers to entry for new projects.\n\n\n\nERC-7683: The Standard for a Unified Ethereum\n\nThis is why we at Across, alongside Uniswap Labs, have proposed ERC-7683, a standard that allows Web3 apps to express complex multi-step crosschain transactions as a single user request that is executed by a shared network of relayers. By standardizing how these requests are expressed, ERC-7683 enables any cross-chain action in the Ethereum ecosystem \u2013 irrespective of origin or destination chain \u2013 to feel as seamless as operating on a single chain.\n\nERC-7683 standard has undergone multiple rounds of community feedback and is broadly supported by over 50 protocols including major projects like Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism and it has the support of the Ethereum Foundation's L2 Interop working group.\n\nAt its core, ERC-7683 simplifies cross-chain operations. Instead of manually managing network switches and bridges, users express what they want to achieve. For example, swapping tokens on Base using funds from Arbitrum becomes a one-click process. Behind the scenes, a network of competitive solvers races to fulfill these intents within seconds, handling all the complexity.\n\n\n\nThis intents-based architecture separates the user\u2019s desired outcome from the mechanical execution, eliminating the need for users to understand or interact with bridges. The result is a \u201chome base\u201d experience, where users can interact with the entire Ethereum ecosystem as if it were one chain.\n\n\n\nSome argue that users don't care about cross-chain \u2013 they just want things to work. They're absolutely right. This is precisely where ERC-7683 comes into play. It enables developers to abstract away all the chain complexity while still leveraging the scale and efficiency of a multi-chain ecosystem. Users benefit from the best of both worlds: the simplicity of one chain with the power of many.\n\nERC-7683 is not theoretical, it is already being used in production through Across implementation, which has processed over $18B in cross-chain volume. The standard builds upon years of development of Across' solver network, extending it into an open and flexible framework that others can build upon.\n\nA Vision for 2025: One Ethereum\n\n\n\nImagine Ethereum in 2025: Users open their wallets and see all their assets across every chain in one view. They interact with any application on any L2 without ever thinking about bridging or network switching. Developers build applications once and seamlessly reach users everywhere. Liquidity flows freely across the ecosystem, maximizing capital efficiency and minimizing costs.\n\n\n\nThis isn't just a dream \u2013 it's becoming reality. ERC-7683 delivers the two-second cross-chain execution speeds needed for seamless experiences. And by standardizing cross-chain interactions, it enables a new generation of applications that treat the entire Ethereum ecosystem as their canvas.\n\n\n\nBeyond Technology: The Path to Mass Adoption\n\n\n\nWhile ERC-7683 is a technical standard, its implications extend beyond technology. By resolving fragmentation, it addresses one of the most significant barriers to mainstream adoption. DeFi becomes more accessible when users no longer need to navigate L2s and bridges. Liquidity improves as assets move seamlessly across marketplaces. Governance participation becomes more inclusive as users can vote from any network.\n\n\n\nThis unified experience positions Ethereum to continue to lead as the pioneer Web3 protocol. While other chains optimize for speed within a single network, Ethereum is building a unified ecosystem that combines the benefits of specialized L2s with the simplicity of a single chain.\n\n\n\nThe Time to Act is Now\n\n\n\nERC-7683 has gained broad support from over 45 teams, including Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, and zkSync, reflecting the Ethereum community's readiness to address fragmentation. Unified standards, shared infrastructure, and collaboration are crucial to overcoming these challenges.\n\n\n\nWith fast L2s, account abstraction, and intent-based bridging already in place, ERC-7683 integrates these innovations into a cohesive standard, setting the stage for Ethereum\u2019s next chapter.\n\n\n\nFragmentation cannot be allowed to hinder Ethereum\u2019s progress. Adopting ERC-7683 is essential for building a unified, accessible ecosystem. L2s, developers, and the broader community are encouraged to embrace this standard to unlock Ethereum's full potential as a scalable and seamless system by 2025.\n\n\n\nLet's make it happen.\n\n\n",

    "content": "Ether (ETH) has underperformed other cryptocurrencies in recent months as the Ethereum blockchain has faced \"intense\" competition from other networks, Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday.\n\nThe token lacks a compelling narrative like that of its larger peer bitcoin (BTC, the bank said, adding that bitcoin benefits from its perception as a store of value and as digital gold.\n\nDespite upgrades, such as Dencun, activity has shifted from the main Ethereum network to its layer 2's, which is detrimental to the blockchain's growth, the report said. The network's latest upgrade, Pectra, is likely to happen in early April.\n\n\"Competitive pressures have led some decentralized applications (dapps) to migrate from Ethereum to other application-specific chains for better performance,\" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.\n\nExamples include decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap, dYdX and Hyperliquid, the bank said. \n\nUniswap's upcoming move to Unichain is important because it is one of Ethereum's \"largest gas consuming protocols,\" and its migration could result in a significant loss to the network's fee pool, the bank noted.\n\nJPMorgan said this trend of dapps moving to other layer 2s or alternative layer 1s could negatively impact Ethereum by lessening activity on the main network, which could result in lower transaction fees and validator revenue.\n\nLayers 2s are separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s, or the base layer, that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data. In terms of supply, this could make ether inflationary as \"fewer transactions imply reduced token burning,\" the authors wrote.\n\nThe bank noted that Ethereum's growth is behind that of competitors such as Solana, which saw a surge in activity linked to memecoins.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem still dominates the stablecoin, decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenization spaces in spite of these challenges, the bank said.\n\nThe network could see increased institutional demand from tokenization enterprises but \"competition from other networks is likely to remain intense in the foreseeable future,\" the report added.\n\nRead more: How to Fix Ethereum's Fragmentation Problem",

    "headline": "Could 'Based Rollups' Solve Ethereum's Layer-2 Problem?",
    "content": "The Ethereum community has been in turmoil over the past few weeks, with members raising the alarm that the chain will lose its competitive edge if it doesn\u2019t address some core design issues.\n\n\n\nA key focus of the outrage has been layer-2 fragmentation. In recent years, Ethereum has embraced a layer-2 scaling roadmap\u2014a plan that encouraged the development of third-party auxiliary networks called \"layer-2 rollups\"\u2014to help scale the base Ethereum ecosystem. Offloading activity to these upstart networks has helped bring down fees and improve speeds for end-users, but it has led to a massive, deeply fragmented ecosystem of layer 2s.\n\n\n\nWhile layer-2 networks all post data back down to Ethereum, they often struggle to communicate directly with one another, meaning passing assets and data between them can become expensive and cumbersome. There's also the risk of centralized sequencers: reliance on company-controlled black boxes to pass transaction data between blockchain layers.\n\n\n\nAs layer-2 chains continue to proliferate, some Ethereum developers are pushing rollup tech that takes a new approach to security and interoperability: \u201cbased rollups.\"\n\n\nBased rollups\n\n\nBased rollups differ from most existing rollups because they shift execution duties\u2014such as processing transactions\u2014back to Ethereum's layer-1 rather than handling them on a separate layer-2 network.\n\n\n\nWhen someone transacts on a layer-2 rollup, their transaction is processed through a component called a \u201csequencer.\u201d The sequencer batches multiple transactions and submits them to Ethereum for settlement. In most rollups today, this sequencer is centralized, meaning a single entity (usually the company that built the rollup) controls the ordering and posting of transactions.\n\n\n\nCentralized sequencers are currently a topic of debate in the Ethereum community. While sequencers provide efficiency and generate revenue for rollup operators by strategically ordering transactions, they also introduce a single point of failure. A malfunctioning or malicious sequencer can delay or manipulate transactions, raising concerns about censorship and reliability.\n\n\n\nBased rollups avoid this vulnerability by using Ethereum\u2019s built-in sequencing\u2014its massive community of validators\u2014rather than a single centralized sequencer.\n\n\n\nThe layer-2 roadmap evolution\n\n\n\nIn 2022, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin laid out his vision for a rollup-centric roadmap. The plan proposed using layer-2 rollups to side-step the base chain's high fees and slow transaction speeds.\n\n\n\nDifferent rollups employ different strategies for keeping down costs and boosting speeds, but they are all designed to uphold decentralization and security\u2014meaning (in theory) the networks shouldn't be centrally run, and the transactions they shepherd to Ethereum are free from tampering.\n\n\n\nRollups like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, zkSync, and Blast have quickly grown to support larger transaction volumes than Ethereum itself. According to L2Beat, there are currently 140 live layer-2 networks, but the experience of operating between them\u2014passing assets and other data between networks\u2014has become clunky. As Ethereum becomes bigger and layer-2 networks become more integral to its functioning, improving communication between layer-2s\u2014in other words, improving \"composability\"\u2014has become more important than ever.\n\n\n\nBecause based rollups share the sequencer from the layer-1 chain (sometimes referred to as the layer-1 \"proposer\"), they can call on smart contracts on other based rollups within seconds, making it easier to access and exchange data across layer-2s.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey effectively share a sequencer with each other and also with the layer-1 and that allows the sequencer now to coordinate messages passing between different based rollups, whereas normally message passing happens in an asynchronous fashion,\u201d said Ben Fisch, the CEO of Espresso Systems, in an interview with CoinDesk.\n\n\n\nSince based rollups all use Ethereum\u2019s built-in sequencing, they can interact with one another instantly, in blockchain terms\u2014all within the same Ethereum block.1\n\n\n\n\u201cYou could have, in the span of one Ethereum block, a based rollup withdraw assets, do something in the layer-1, deposit the assets back, do something in the layer-2 and withdraw assets again,\u201d Fisch told CoinDesk.\n\n\n\nSome drawbacks\n\nA few projects are looking to use based technology, but only one based rollup, Taiko, is currently live.\n\n\n\nWhile rollups like Taiko present clear benefits, they will need to overcome some technical hurdles before they can be more widely adopted.\n\n\n\nOne major challenge is proof generation. When a based rollup submits transaction data to Ethereum, it must generate and publish proofs every 12 seconds\u2014matching Ethereum\u2019s block time. Currently, layer-2 rollups use two types of proof systems: zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, which finalize in minutes, and optimistic proofs, which take up to seven days to suss out potential fraud.\n\n\n\nFor based rollups to function efficiently, proof generation speeds would need to align with Ethereum\u2019s block time\u2014a significant technical leap. However, Fisch says a breakthrough on this front could be \"imminent. \"\n\n\n\nThe other pitfall is Ethereum's block producers, or \"layer-1 proposers.\" In based rollups, these proposers take over the role of sequencing transactions. But their primary motivation isn\u2019t necessarily fairness\u2014it\u2019s profit\n\n\n\n\u201cLayer-1 proposers are not trusted entities that are working in the interest of the layer-2, they are economically motivated to make as much money as they can,\u201d Fisch said. \u201cSo they may confirm some transactions for end users, and then see an MEV opportunity, which causes them to publish something totally different.\u201d\n\n\n\nMEV, or maximal extractable value, refers to the practice of reordering transactions to maximize profit, often at the expense of regular users. If proposers manipulate transactions, it could create instability in based rollups. To address this, developers are working on solutions like based pre-confirmations, which aim to add economic incentives for proposers to act in the interest of rollups.\n\n\n\nSo while based rollups may present a promising way to reduce fragmentation between layer-2s, they're not a miracle fix. \u201cMy personal opinion is that based rollups are one part of the solution, they are not the only solution, and not all layer-2s necessarily should or will be based,\u201d Fisch said.\n\n\n\nRead more: \u2018Sequencers\u2019 Are Blockchain\u2019s Air Traffic Control.

Lido currently allows investors to pool their ether (ETH) together and \"stake\" their crypto \u2014 locking up their tokens with the network, helping to secure it in exchange for interest. Lido pioneered liquid staking: users get a receipt on their deposits called Lido staked ETH (stETH) that they can trade at any time. With liquid staking on Lido, entering and exiting staking positions became as simple as buying and selling stETH tokens. Lido V3's stVaults are \u201cmodular smart contracts designed to meet the diverse and evolving needs of Ethereum participants,\u201d according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. The upgrade would enable staking setups beyond cut-and-dry liquid staking. Specifically, stVaults will be able to help institutional stakers who want to personalize their staking setups, node operators who want to attract high-volume stakers, and asset managers who want to create new staking use cases. \u201cWhat is important to understand with customizable infrastructure, is that you can in general build even more complex products,\u201d said Konstantin Lomashuk, the founder of the Lido staking protocol. \u2014 Margaux Nijkerk Read more. \n\nUNICHAIN FINALLY: Uniswap Labs, the primary developer behind one of the largest decentralized exchanges (DEX), Uniswap, shared Feb 13 that its long-awaited layer-2 network, Unichain, is now live. Powered by Optimism's OP stack, Unichain\u2014like other layer-2s on Ethereum\u2014offers faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum's mainnet. Developers can deploy apps onto the network, which has been optimized specifically for decentralized finance (DeFi) and aims to serve as \"the home for liquidity across chains,\" according to Uniswap Labs. For Uniswap Labs, the benefit of launching a layer-2 is twofold: it will provide a better experience for users of Uniswap and similar platforms, and it will create a new revenue opportunity in the form of network fees. A representative for Uniswap Labs told CoinDesk that \"around 20%\" of the chain's revenue will go directly to the company. Unichain has been in testing since October 2024 and is classified by Uniswap Labs as a \"stage-1\" rollup, meaning it has elements of decentralization but retains some centrally-controlled safeguards at this early phase. The network is built on the OP Stack, a modular framework that lets developers build interoperable layer-2 chains based on Optimism\u2019s optimistic rollup technology. Several well-known teams have come out with their own OP Stack-based layer-2\u2019s, including Coinbase's \u2018Base\u2019, Kraken\u2019s \u2018Ink,\u2019 World\u2019s \u2018World chain,\u2019 and Sony\u2019s \u2018Soneium.\u2019 \u201cWe are anticipating a world of many, many different use cases, of which trading is a small subset,\u201d Adams told CoinDesk in an interview. In collaboration with Ethereum research and development firm Flashbots, the Uniswap team said it has created a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on Unichain, a secure area for more sensitive transactions and is meant to optimize the chain for DeFi by allowing for more advanced trades and faster transaction finality. \u2014 Margaux Nijkerk Read more.\n\nPECTRA IN APRIL: Ethereum developers have officially set test dates for Pectra, the network's first upgrade in 11 months, putting it on track for a potential April release date. Pectra will contain an array of improvements \u2014 with a special focus on wallets and validators \u2014 but it comes at a period of heightened scrutiny for Ethereum, which has recently faced pressure from its community to refocus and catch up with competitors. Ethereum's core builders decided on Thursday during their bi-weekly \"All Core Developers\" call to begin testing Pectra on Feb. 26 on the Holesky testnet, with a follow-up test on the network's Sepolia testnet slated for Mar. 5. Should those tests succeed, the developers will reconvene on Mar. 6 to determine when to launch the upgrade officially. According to Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, developers expect the upgrade to hit mainnet in early April. Pectra \u2014 a portmanteau representing two separate upgrades, Prague and Electra \u2014 includes eight major improvements to the second-largest blockchain. Among the most-anticipated is EIP-7702, which is supposed to improve the user experience of crypto wallets. The Ethereum community has been facing an identity crisis over the last few weeks. Its native token, ether (ETH), is underperforming against other cryptocurrencies, and competitor networks like Solana have drawn attention and talent from the Ethereum ecosystem \u2014 the first-ever programmable blockchain and still the most trafficked. Amid the controversy \u2014 much of it directed at the Etheruem Foundation, which coordinates chain upgrades and is currently undergoing a major leadership shuffle \u2014 developers are hoping that Pectra will help put the network on steadier footing. \u2014 Margaux Nijkerk Read more.\n\nMoney Center\n\nEl Salvador Dispatch\n\nBerl\u00edn, a city of 20,000 people, is home to El Salvador\u2019s second Bitcoin circular economy. \u201cBitcoin City already exists.

    "content": "A group of top Ethereum developers and leaders released Wednesday a new framework that would simplify and standardize cross-chain token transfers.\n\n\n\nThe initiative, called the Open Intents Framework (OIF), was kickstarted by contributors from the Ethereum Foundation and is supported by 25 projects including teams building layer-2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, ZKsync, and Scroll, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the initiative is to bring \u201cintents\u201d to all corners of the Ethereum ecosystem, which is a technological feature that lets a blockchain user accomplish a specific goal by asking an intermediary to fulfill that goal (like a trade or transaction they want to make.)\n\n\n\nThere are some standards out there that are already trying to make cross-chain transactions easier by using intents. ERC-7683, which was introduced by the team behind the decentralized exchange Uniswap and the Across protocol, is one of those standards circulating the Ethereum space lately, and is supposed to address fragmentation and allow more chains in the Ethereum ecosystem to interoperate.\n\n\n\nBut the OIF team claims that they will build on that standard through their framework allowing intents to function at scale. \u201cBy offering shared infrastructure and execution coordination, OIF makes intent-based transactions permissionless, efficient, and accessible for all projects,\u201d the press release said.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs Ethereum's ecosystem becomes increasingly multichain, intents help streamline fragmented user experiences by enabling seamless, near-instant cross-chain transactions through specialized solvers. However, integrating intents remains complex and resource-intensive, making an open intents framework essential to standardize infrastructure, reduce barriers to adoption, and foster broader collaboration across the ecosystem,\u201d the team shared with CoinDesk.\n\nRead more: 'Intents' Are Blockchain's Big New Buzzword.

Through seamless wallet integration, we ensure proof of control for sellers and proof of funds for buyers, enhancing security and trust.\u201d\n\nSecondary markets for locked tokens refer to platforms or mechanisms where tokens that are under some form of lock-up or vesting schedule can be traded before they are fully released or unlocked.\n\nThese markets provide a way for holders of locked tokens to gain liquidity, meaning they can convert their holdings into cash or other assets before the tokens are fully unlocked \u2014 giving early liquidity to sellers and the chance of gaining assets at a discount for buyers.\n\nSecondSwap has introduced a bid campaign to facilitate price discovery and enhance liquidity in early weeks, allowing traders to set their own prices and support matching between buyers and sellers once the buy/sell flow feature is enabled.\n\nTraders link their wallets, accessing a list of locked tokens that they can express an interest in buying by setting their preferred price target. Participants will be notified when inventory is available at prevailing prices, ensuring early adopters can engage with new opportunities as they emerge.\n\nThe platform plans to expand to the Solana network in the coming months, a feat Lee says could unlock over $500 million in volume.\n\n\u201cLocked token liquidity represents billions of dollars of untapped value.

    "content": "CORRECTION (Feb. 22, 19:16 UTC): Reworks the story throughout to clarify and include more context of the so-called \"rollback\" and the criticism around it. Also removed the percentage of ETH held by hackers in 2016).\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and major ether (ETH) holder, asked Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin if he would be willing to entertain the idea of rolling back the network to assist hacked exchange Bybit, which lost nearly $1.4 billion in ether (ETH) on Friday.\n\n\"@VitalikButerin will you advocate to roll back the chain to help @Bybit_Official,\" Hayes said in the social media post. \n\n\"My own view as a mega $ETH bag holder is $ETH stopped being money in 2016 after the DAO hack hardfork. If the community wanted to do it again, I would support it because we already voted no on immutability in 2016 [wh]y not do it again?\" he added \n\nButerin was yet to reply as of time of publication.  \n\nWhile some, including Unchained's Laura Shin, wondered if Hayes's post was a joke, it did raise a serious question about whether rolling back is even feasible. CoinDesk reached out to Hayes about the post and hasn't received a comment at the time of writing. \n\n\"I wish we could roll back for the Bybit hack, I'm not against the idea. But the DAO hack was 15% of ETH with a clean recovery path. Today, a rollback would break bridges, stablecoins, L2s, RWAs and so much more. ETH ecosystem is just too interconnected now for a clean solution like 2016,\" said Gautham Santhosh, co-founder of\u00a0Polynomial.fi.\n\nThe problem with \"rollback\"\n\nHayes' suggestions of rolling back the blockchain as one of the potential ways to address hacking involves reverting the blockchain to a state before a specific event, in this case, the hack. That way, malicious transactions resulting from the hack can be erased, effectively restoring lost or stolen funds. Implementing a rollback requires consensus from the network participants.\n\nFor instance, in 2016, the Ethereum network saw a controversial revision of the network using a hard fork to reverse a theft of $60 million in ether from The DAO (the percentage the hackers took control of is still up for debate). The hard fork split the chain into two \u2013 Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. \n\nHowever, the term \"rollback\" was never used during that revision; it was referred to as an \u201cirregular state transition.\u201d The move still triggered huge and important debates over so-called \u201cimmutability\u201d in blockchains.\n\nImmutability is a security feature that prevents data from being changed after it's added to the blockchain, making it trustworthy and tamper-proof. \n\nA similar controversy played out in the Bitcoin community in 2019 when Binance's CEO Changpeng Zhao and his team considered pushing for a \"rollback\" approach (the term was later rephrased by CZ as \"re-org\" and decided not to pursue the approach) on the Bitcoin network following a $40 million hack. However, the Bitcoin mining community criticized the idea of going back against the principle of decentralization and immutability.\n\nSimilarly, the Ethereum community criticized the idea of \"rollback\" in this case, noting that the idea wouldn't even have been considered by the community.\n\nTheoretically, an actual \"rollback\" won't be possible on Ethereum, as the network uses something called \"accounts\" to store the ether, which can be analogous to bank accounts. When the 2016 hack occurred, the nodes upgraded to new software, and the ETH held was moved to new addresses.\n\nHowever, the idea of reversing a transaction in light of a hack isn't a new one; at least one smaller blockchain network, Vericoin, actually executed such a procedure previously.\n\nThe Bybit hack came into light on Friday when on-chain sleuth ZachXBT noted suspicious outflows of over $1.4 billion from the exchange, with the attacker quickly swapping mETH and stETH for ether through a decentralized exchange.\n\nThe hackers were later identified by ZachXBT as the North Korean Lazarus Group. \n\nThe attacker then split 10,000 ETH to 39 different addresses and another 10,000 ETH to nine addresses, Polynomial.fi's Santhosh said on X.\n\nBybit CEO Ben Zhou\u00a0said\u00a0that the hacker \"took control of the specific ETH cold wallet and transferred all the ETH in the cold wallet to this unidentified address.\" Zhou confirmed that the exchange \"is solvent even if this hack loss is not recovered.\"\n\nMargaux Nijkerk contributed to the revised story.\nRead more: Ether Price Spikes Further on Reports of Bybit Starting to Buy ETH",

    "content": "Ethereum\u2019s Pectra upgrade went live on the Holesky testnet on Monday but failed to finalize in the expected time.\n\n\n\nPectra was activated on the Holesky testnet at 21:55 UTC (4:55 p.m. ET), but did not initially finalize according to blockchain data.\n\n\n\nFinality is the state in which, once a transaction is confirmed and added to a block, it is immutable and cannot be reversed. A testnet is a network that copies a main blockchain (in this case Ethereum), and is used to test upgrades or new code before it goes to the main network.\n\n\n\nIt is not immediately clear why the Pectra upgrade did not finalize on Holesky. Ethereum developers were discussing Monday over the Eth R&D Discord channel what the issue could be.\n\n\n\nThis is not the first time an upgrade has not finalized on an Etheruem test network. In January 2024, when the developers were testing the Dencun upgrade, the hard fork did not initially finalize on the Goerli testnet.\n\n\n\nWhat is Pectra?\n\n\n\nThe Pectra hard fork combines together 11 major upgrades, or \"Ethereum improvement proposals\" (EIPs), into one package. At the heart of this is EIP-7702, which is supposed to improve the user-experience of crypto wallets. The proposal, which was scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in just 22 minutes, will allow wallets to have some smart contract capabilities, as part of a broader strategy to bring account abstraction to Ethereum \u2014 a concept that makes the usability of wallets a lot less clunky.\n\n\n\nAnother key proposal, EIP-7251, will allow validators to increase the maximum amount they can stake from 32 to 2,048 ETH. The proposal is supposed to ease some of the technicalities that validators who stake ETH face today: Those that stake more than their 32 ETH have to spread that across multiple validators, making the process a bit of a nuisance. By lifting the maximum stake limit and combining those validators, it could speed up the process of setting up new nodes.\n\n\n\nHolesky is the first of two testnets to run through a simulation of Pectra. The next test is supposed to occur on the Sepolia testnet on Mar. 5. But according to Christine Kim, a Vice President of Research at Galaxy, developers could delay it depending on the scale of today's issue.\n\n\n\nAfter Pectra goes live on both testnets, developers will ink in a final date to activate the upgrade on mainnet.\n\n\n\nPectra was originally on track to be Ethereum\u2019s biggest upgrade to date, and it's the first big change to the blockchain in almost a year. Developers decided that Pectra was too ambitious, and they agreed to split the original package into two.\n\n\n\nRead more: Ethereum Developers Finally Schedule \u2018Pectra\u2019 Upgrade",

GitHub is a popular tool among developers of all types, but even more so among crypto-focused projects, where a simple application may generate millions of dollars in revenue. The report warned users of a \u201cGitVenom\u201d campaign that\u2019s been active for at least two years but is steadily on the rise, involving planting malicious code in fake projects on the popular code repository platform. The attack starts with seemingly legitimate GitHub projects \u2014 like making Telegram bots for managing bitcoin wallets or tools for computer games. Each comes with a polished README file, often AI-generated, to build trust. But the code itself is a Trojan horse: For Python-based projects, attackers hide nefarious script after a bizarre string of 2,000 tabs, which decrypts and executes a malicious payload. For JavaScript, a rogue function is embedded in the main file, triggering the launch attack. Once activated, the malware pulls additional tools from a separate hacker-controlled GitHub repository. Once the system is infected, various other programs kick in to execute the exploit. How can users protect themselves? By scrutinizing any code before running it, verifying the project\u2019s authenticity, and being suspicious of overly polished READMEs or inconsistent commit histories. Because researchers don\u2019t expect these attacks to stop anytime soon: \u201cWe expect these attempts to continue in the future, possibly with small changes in the TTPs,\u201d Kaspersky said. \u2014 Shaurya Malwa Read more.\n\nIn Other News\n\nMiners Pivoting to AI, But Bitcoin Still Makes Sense\n\nPublic bitcoin miners are rushing to build AI business lines, but there\u2019s still room for their original mandate, says this investment bank analyst.

However, hours after the test, Sepolia began to encounter errors. It was the second buggy test for the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade, which is designed to improve Ethereum's efficiency, user experience, and validator system. The issues have led to calls from some developers that the upgrade be delayed. Wednesday\u2019s Sepolia test (March 5) was expected to be the final step before Pectra\u2019s launch on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet. Initially, the test appeared to succeed, but later, developers noticed empty blocks being added to the chain. The Ethereum Foundation attributed the issue to \"an issue with Sepolia's permissioned deposit contract,\" which \"prevented many execution layer clients from including transactions in blocks.\" In other words, the problem stemmed from a misconfiguration specific to the Sepolia test, rather than a flaw with Pectra itself. Despite this, the test has raised concerns about whether Pectra has undergone sufficient testing. The previous test on Ethereum\u2019s Holesky testnet also ran into configuration issues, that time caused by misconfigured validators. \u2014 Sam Kessler Read more.\n\nETHEREUM FOUNDATION PICKS NEW CO-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS: The Ethereum Foundation (EF), the non-profit organization that supports the development and research of the Ethereum blockchain, shared in a blog post that they have selected Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Sta\u0144czak as their new co-executive directors.

Part of Metamask's revamped roadmap includes adding smart contract capabilities to its current wallet. At the moment, MetaMask is an Externally Owned Account (EOA), a type of wallet that is controlled by a public and a private key. One of the main downfalls with EOAs is that it is subject to human error, meaning if you forget your private key, you lose your crypto holdings in that account forever. The other type of wallet that exists on Ethereum are Contract Accounts (CAs), which are controlled by code and have recovery mechanisms in place and security checks for verifying transactions. In a blog post shared during ETHDenver, the largest North American Ethereum conference, the MetaMask team said \u201csmart-contract-based accounts allow us to solve a number of problems: allowing new powerful uses of the assets you hold, while simultaneously improving security. When the user defines their terms from their own programmable account, we greatly expand how the user expresses their agency in ways that are enforced by their own code.\u201d One of those new features aimed at making the user experience on MetaMask easier include ERC-5792, which builds on its current feature, smart transactions. Under ERC-5792, or known as batched transactions, users can combine certain steps when it comes to signing off transactions, like \u201capprove + swap\u201d in one click, meaning that they would save time and gas fees by batching those steps together. \u2014 Margaux Nijkerk Read more.\n\nIn Other News\n\nTrading Titan Jump Is Regrouping Its U.S. Crypto Efforts, Insiders Say\n\nWhile Jump has maintained its digital assets trading and market-making activity in other parts of the globe, crypto trading volume is now accelerating globally, according to a person familiar with the situation.

    "headline": "Ethereum Developers Postpone Pectra Upgrade Following Buggy Tests",
    "content": "After two buggy test runs of Pectra, Ethereum's biggest upgrade since 2024, the network's developers decided on Thursday to postpone the upgrade pending further tests.\n\n\n\nPectra, which was planned as Ethereum faced mounting pressure to compete with other blockchains, contains a slate of upgrades designed to improve Ethereum's speed and ease of use.\n\n\n\nWhen developers inked in the test dates for Pectra in January, they agreed to use the Thursday, Mar. 6 call to set a date for Pectra to go live on the mainnet. If all went well, the expectation was that the upgrade would go live in March.\n\n\n\nThe decision to postpone came after Pectra's tests on Holesky and Sepolia, Ethereum's two primary test networks, both encountered bugs. In both cases, the problems resulted from misconfigurations with the test rather than issues with Pectra itself.\n\n\n\nUnder normal circumstances, these two tests would have been enough. However, due to the bugs, developers determined on Thursday that Pectra should undergo additional testing before it goes live on Ethereum's main network.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt seems like we need more information before we can really set a concrete date,\u201d said Alex Stokes, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation who led Thursday\u2019s call.\n\n\n\nAs for next steps, developers decided on Thursday to create a \"shadow fork\" of the Holesky test network, which has been inoperable since the last Pectra upgrade. The Pectra test's configuration issues forced many of Holesky's validators offline, meaning the network can no longer record transactions properly.\n\n\n\nA shadow fork is a temporary copy of a blockchain network that is discarded once it is no longer needed. Holesky is a vitally important testing area for Ethereum's developers, and a shadow fork will allow certain key stakeholders \u2014 like staking pools and app developers \u2014 to test their code on Pectra while the main Holesky network is being fixed.\n\n\n\n\"Anyone who wants to test on Holesky can test there,\u201d Stokes recapped on Thursday's call. In the meantime, developers will work to get the primary Holesky network back up and running, which will require 67% of the validators who run the network to reconfigure their systems and come back online. \n\n\n\nOnce Holeksy can finalize once again \u2014 meaning it's able to add and record transactions as usual \u2014 \"we'll have more data to make a call on the next steps around mainnet and launching Pectra,\u201d said Stokes. Developers say Holesky will be operating normally again by around March 28.\n\n\n\nPectra\u2019s Improvements\n\nPectra is set to be one of the blockchain\u2019s most ambitious changes to date, aimed at improving ease of use for both users and operators of the network.\n\n\n\nOne of the upgrade's main additions, EIP-7702, gives crypto wallets some smart contract capabilities. The change is meant to move Ethereum further towards account abstraction, a technological feature that lets wallet builders add user-friendly features, like the ability to pay for fees with currencies other than Ethereum's native ETH.\n\n\n\nAnother key proposal, EIP-7251, will alleviate some headaches for Ethereum's operators, or \"validators.\" The change will increase the maximum amount of ETH one validator can stake from 32 to 2,048, meaning those who stake more than 32 ETH will no longer need to split their assets between so many nodes. The change is meant to improve convenience for validators and reduce the amount of time it takes to spin up a new node.\n\n\n\nThursday's postponement came as community members had already voiced frustration with the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that stewards Ethereum's development and coordinates network upgrades.\n\n\n\nThe foundation's critics argue that Ethereum has failed to develop a cohesive roadmap that will help it compete with ascendent networks like Solana. They point to the lagging price of ether (ETH) as a sign of waning confidence from the wider market.\n\n\n\nRead more: Ethereum's Second Buggy 'Pectra' Test Could Lead to a Delayed Upgrade\n\n\n",

    "content": "One of the foremost projects aiming to increase the speed of the Ethereum network is ramping up its work on the world's original blockchain: Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum layer-2 Starknet, in partnership with BTC wallet Xverse, is aiming to deliver a \"full DeFi experience to Bitcoin users.\"\n\nXverse said it will \"achieve Bitcoin's DeFi take-off moment,\" through integrating with Starknet in Q2 2025, in an emailed announcement on Tuesday.\n\nThe partnership with Xverse comes amid a period of increased research into Bitcoin scaling using Starknet.\n\nThe Starknet Foundation has published a new Bitcoin Roadmap, which described how Starknet would remain fully active on Ethereum, while \"becoming Bitcoin's execution layer,\" with the goal of scaling the network \"from 13 TPS to thousands.\"\n\nDevelopers have been increasingly exploring how to tap the security and deep reserves held in BTC to empower the broader DeFi and blockchain world. The challenge has been how to address Bitcoin's relative lack of programability compared to Ethereum and others.\n\nLayer 2s like Starknet aim to address this by acting as an execution layer, doing the heavy lifting of processing transactions, which are then ultimately given finality through settlement on Bitcoin. \n\nFor many observers, the missing piece is OP_CAT: a proposed implementation to the Bitcoin network that could unlock hitherto unseen programmability, which would be pivotal to the provision for DeFi. \n\nCrucially, OP_CAT could allow zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic method of  proving the validity of statements without offering information that may compromise privacy.\n\nOP_CAT is not short of supporters, but its future as a Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) remains uncertain. However, Starknet and Xverse's plan is to make Bitcoin DeFi a reality even without it. \n\nXverse's aim is to provide a Bitcoin DeFi experience in its wallet using trust assumptions as the next big thing to zero-knowledge proofs until such a time that OP_CAT is adopted.\n\n\u201cObviously, the endgame is trustless DeFi on Bitcoin,\u201d Xverse founder Ken Liao said in Tuesday's announcement. \u201cThis will still have \u2018training wheels\u2019 of some trust assumptions, but it is still hugely exciting to be delivering  the most accurate preview so far of what intuitive DeFi on Bitcoin will look and feel like.\"",

    "headline": "From Ethereum's Engine Room to Wall Street: Danny Ryan's New Mission",
    "content": "As controversy swirled around the Ethereum Foundation (EF) this winter, one of Ethereum's most respected architects was quietly plotting his next move. Danny Ryan\u2014a key visionary behind Ethereum's most ambitious upgrade, \"The Merge\"\u2014left the EF in September but entered talks a few months later to rejoin the organization as its new leader.\n\n\n\n\"I was in conversation with Vitalik [Buterin] and others to potentially go back to help run the Ethereum Foundation,\" Ryan revealed in a candid interview with CoinDesk. But as the non-profit behind the second-largest blockchain underwent a dramatic leadership reshuffle, Ryan's trajectory unexpectedly shifted elsewhere \u2014 towards bringing Ethereum to Wall Street.\n\n\n\nThe changes at the Ethereum Foundation came amid growing community unrest. Critics blamed the foundation for their perception that Ethereum was losing momentum to ascendant rivals like Solana. The reshuffling included moving Aya Miyaguchi, the foundation's executive director since 2018, to the role of president.\n\n\n\nRather than Ryan taking Miyaguchi's previous position, the foundation's day-to-day leadership transferred to Hsiao-Wei Wang, an EF researcher, and Tomasz Sta\u0144czak, the founder of Ethereum's Nethermind client software.\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss non-profit, is the main organization supporting the development of the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. It stewards a treasury of Ethereum's ether (ETH) tokens, which it distributes through grants to ecosystem projects. It also staffs a team of developers and researchers who play a key role in coordinating updates and shaping the chain's roadmap.\n\n\n\nIn January, as the EF leadership shakeup was underway, Ryan \"ended up mutually parting ways\" with Buterin and the foundation, he said. \"Soon after, I got introduced to Vivek [Raman],\" one of the founders of Etherealize, a new firm aimed at bringing ether (ETH) products to Wall Street. In March, Ryan announced he would be joining Etherealize as a co-founder.\n\n\n\nRyan says he made the move because he believes Ethereum is at a technological inflection point: \"Ethereum is much bigger than the EF. It's not just a couple of changes at the EF that are going to make or break Ethereum at large.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Ryan, what the ecosystem needs now more than ever is to get its technology into the hands of real users. \"The only reason that things are maybe more existential right now than in times past is that the world is actually ready to adopt these systems,\" said Ryan. \"It is existential that Ethereum \u2014 a truly open, decentralized, permissionless platform \u2014 is the one that's adopted.\"\n\n\n\nFrom Web3 to Wall Street\n\nAt Etherealize, Ryan aims to connect Ethereum's technical ecosystem with institutional finance. The company is developing financial products that will make Ethereum more accessible to traditional investors while maintaining the blockchain's core values.\n\n\n\nAs a researcher at the EF, Ryan played a central role in mapping out Ethereum\u2019s ambitious upgrade from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, known as the Merge. He believes his close ties to one of the most influential organizations in the Ethereum space will benefit his new work at Etherealize.\n\n\n\n\u201cMe coming on board, we get to kind of make that bridge bi-directional. I have deep Ethereum context \u2013 I helped build the protocol,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI know all the people working on it. I know the challenges at hand and understand how things might unfold over the next few years. And so I can serve as a bridge from Ethereum back into the real world.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs for Ryan's role, specifically, his responsibilities are not totally defined: \"I would love for Etherealize to take on the mandate of doing some open [research and development], and being a player in layer-1 or layer-2 or application layer R&D. But we're still kind of figuring out the lay of the land there.\"\n\n\n\nIndustry watchers note that Ryan's move comes at a pivotal moment for both Ethereum and institutional crypto adoption. With a new regulatory environment for crypto under U.S. President Donald Trump, traditional financial firms \u2014 in the United States, in particular \u2014 are expected to become more comfortable adopting blockchain technology. Ryan hopes his technical bona fides could help these integrations meet Wall Street's rigorous standards without compromising on crypto's core ideals.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe plan to bring the entire world onto Ethereum to whatever extent that we can, and having a deep technical background and understanding about Ethereum from a very fundamental way is going to help us do that,\u201d Ryan said.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead for the Ethereum Foundation\n\nWhen asked about the timing of his departure from the EF amid growing criticisms of the organization, Ryan offered a measured perspective. \"A lot of what we've seen is just market dynamics, regardless of fundamental value, painting people's perspectives on things, and they sometimes look for someone to blame or put a finger at,\" he explained, referencing the ETH price volatility that has sometimes colored public sentiment about the project.\n\n\n\nRyan remains optimistic about the changes coming to the foundation he once considered leading. \"I'm excited for some new blood,\" he said. \"I've known Aya since January 2018; we've worked very closely together for years. I've said publicly that I admire her leadership, and I think she's made a number of really important calls on how to run the EF.\"\n\n\n\nHe added that he's \"excited for the two leaders\" that were elevated to replace Miyaguchi. \"They have very technical backgrounds and a deep understanding of Ethereum, both the positive and the negative in terms of the construction of the protocol.\"\n\n\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s New Cheerleader on Wall Street: A Q&A With Vivek Raman",

    "content": "Following two problematic tests of Ethereum's upcoming Pectra upgrade, the network's core developers decided on Thursday to create a new testnet to demonstrate the code update a final time before deployment.\n\n\"A new testnet, Hoodi, is going live Monday to wrap up Pectra testing,\" said Tim Beiko, who coordinates the ecosystem's core developers at the Ethereum Foundation, in an X post following a developer call on Thursday. Pectra will be tested on Hoodi on Wednesday, March 26 \u2014 when the test chain will be upgraded to the new version of Ethereum and evaluated for performance and stability.\n\nPectra includes several code changes designed to make Ethereum faster, more efficient, and more user-friendly for both users and developers. One of the most significant improvements adds \"smart contract\" functionality to addresses, allowing user wallets to be programmed with new features, such as the ability to pay transaction fees in currencies other than ETH.\n\nIf the Hoodi test succeeds, Beiko said developers will launch the upgrade after approximately 30 days, subject to further testing. Should everything proceed as planned, Ethereum users can expect Pectra to reach the ecosystem's main network in late April or early May.\n\nThe Hoodi testnet was created following complications with Pectra tests on Sepolia and Holesky, Ethereum's primary test networks. In both instances, configuration errors prevented proper testing of the Pectra upgrade. In Holesky's case, the network was offline for multiple weeks due to the flawed test issues.\n\nTest networks like Holesky, Sepolia, and Hoodi function almost identically to the main Ethereum network but are generally free to use and not intended to support real value. Major upgrades like Pectra are typically implemented on Ethereum's test networks before full deployment on the mainnet, as any disruptions on the actual Ethereum network could be extremely costly.\n\nAccording to Beiko, Sepolia and Holesky \u2014 which are now running Pectra successfully \u2014 serve different testing purposes. \"If you need to test validator exits, be on the lookout for [Hoodi]! Everything else can be tested on Sepolia & Holesky,\" Beiko stated in his Thursday post on X.\n\nPectra's technical setbacks come during a challenging period for Ethereum. The network has faced mounting pressure from declining ETH prices, leadership transitions at the Ethereum Foundation, and growing skepticism about its ability to maintain market dominance amid competition from newer blockchains like Solana. Industry figures view the successful implementation of Pectra as crucial for restoring confidence in Ethereum's technical roadmap.\n\nCORRECTION: (Fri 14, 07:04 UTC) Changes name of testnet from Hooli to Hoodi.",

    "headline": "How Funding Fragmentation Holds Ethereum Back",
    "content": "Ethereum has undergone a big transformation in the last four years, starting as a network capable of handling just 15 transactions per second, and evolving to a powerhouse processing thousands, with transaction costs decreasing from $50 per swap to mere cents. L2s and rollups have helped scale Ethereum without compromising its decentralized ethos. But this success has led to a new problem, one of fragmentation.\n\n\n\nToday, Ethereum is one of the most widely adopted blockchains, consisting of a network of over 50 L2s, each operating as its own siloed ecosystem. What this means for end-users is having to juggle multiple networks, bridge assets, and navigate a maze of processes just to perform basic actions.\n\n\n\nMirroring the fragmented technological landscape, Ethereum\u2019s funding landscape has become difficult to navigate for builders across the lifecycle, stalling innovation as projects struggle to secure sustainable funding.\n\n\n\nTo create a more efficient ecosystem, Ethereum needs to start adopting blockchain-based funding mechanisms that better align with its complex, community-based and experimental nature.\n\nTraditional funding programs often focus on early-stage projects, neglecting the long-term needs of builders in Web3. It can be misleading to look at crypto market narratives dominating the investment landscape and assume a booming activity. Financial returns for many of those projects might not come in the short-term, leaving builders struggling to navigate to sustainable growth. Funding mechanisms have to be able to support builders throughout the entire journey of the product lifecycle.\n\nRewarding impact, not speculation\n\nOne of the most promising blockchain-powered funding models is RetroPGF, which flips the traditional funding script by rewarding projects based on their proven impact rather than their speculative potential. This model is particularly well-suited to Ethereum\u2019s fragmented ecosystem, where public goods like open-source software, developer tools, and interoperability solutions often struggle to attract upfront investment.\n\n\n\nRetroPGF focuses on measurable outcomes of a project. It pools funds from DAOs or ecosystem contributors and distributes them retroactively to projects that have demonstrated value. This process ensures that critical infrastructure \u2014 like cross-chain bridges or developer frameworks \u2014 receives the support it needs at the right time.\n\n\n\nThis funding mechanism is preferred because it helps align incentives. Instead of competing for speculative investment, projects can focus on delivering real value, knowing that their contributions will be recognized and rewarded. For a fragmented ecosystem like Ethereum, RetroPGF offers a way to unify funding efforts and ensure that resources flow to the most impactful initiatives.\n\nAmplifying community support\n\nAnother powerful tool in the blockchain funding toolkit is quadratic funding, a model that distributes capital based on the breadth of community support rather than the size of individual contributions. This approach levels the playing field for smaller projects and grassroots initiatives, which often struggle to compete with well-funded competitors in traditional funding models.\n\n\n\nQuadratic funding works by matching small donations from a large number of supporters with a larger pool of funds, reflecting the collective intelligence of the community and ensuring that projects with widespread grassroots support receive the majority of funding.\n\n\n\nBy tokenizing the value of public goods projects, such as governance rights or revenue streams, founders can open their projects to a broader pool of supporters with the help of fractional investing mechanisms. This creates a diverse and passionate investor base, democratizing access to capital and reducing reliance on traditional funding sources.\n\n\n\nFor example, developers building a cross-chain interoperability solution could tokenize their project\u2019s governance rights, allowing supporters to contribute micro-investments in exchange for a stake in its success. This not only provides the project with much-needed funding but also fosters a sense of ownership and alignment among its supporters.\n\n\n\nIn a fragmented ecosystem like Ethereum, fractional investing can help bridge the gaps between chains by incentivizing collaboration and shared ownership. Projects that might otherwise operate in isolation can tap into a unified pool of capital, creating a more interconnected and resilient ecosystem.\n\nOn-chain ownership\n\nAt the heart of these blockchain-powered funding models is the concept of on-chain ownership. By tokenizing their work and leveraging blockchain\u2019s transparency, creators and builders can establish direct relationships with their supporters, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring that value flows back to those who believed in them from the start.\n\n\n\nOn-chain transactions also make funding flows visible and auditable, reducing fraud and fostering trust. This transparency is particularly important in a fragmented ecosystem like Ethereum, where users and developers often struggle to navigate complex and opaque funding structures.\n\n\n\nAn important question to address is how to source funding for these x-L2 initiatives.\n\n\n\nOne strategy is to make funding Ethereum common goods a condition of being a Stage 1 or Stage 2 rollup. These rollups, once they\u2019ve reached that level of decentralization, are relying on a distributed community and tools for governance. Funding these common goods and tools is not only justified but necessary for their continued growth.\n\n\n\nAn alternative would be to redirect the Ethereum Foundation grants program towards solving this issue. The EF needs to better support the cross-L2 experience and funding common goods to solve these challenges is key to doing so.\n\n\n\nEthereum\u2019s fragmentation goes beyond technical challenges, it\u2019s a funding challenge above all others. By adopting blockchain-powered funding models like RetroPGF, quadratic funding, and fractional investing, the ecosystem offers a way to align incentives, amplify community support, and democratize access to capital, ensuring that resources flow to the projects that need them most.",

In this issue: Ethereum\u2019s Final Pectra Test Goes Live Hyperliquid Eases Token Transfers for DeFi Celo Migration to Layer-2 Network Is Done Bitcoin DeFi Expansion Faces Fork Dilemma This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol , our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Network news IT\u2019S ALIVE! ETHEREUM PECTRA TEST: The final dress rehearsal for Ethereum\u2019s upcoming Pectra upgrade occurred Wednesday, as the blockchain's biggest changes in over a year were tested an additional time following a series of mishaps. The upgrade on the new Hoodi testnet was closely watched given that two previous tests , on the Holesky and Sepolia test networks, failed to finalize properly. Following those tests, developers created a new testnet , Hoodi, to give ecosystem players, particularly staking providers, one more testing opportunity before the Pectra upgrade hits Ethereum\u2019s mainnet. The test involved passing Hoodi a series of code changes meant to make Ethereum more user-friendly for both end-users as well as developers. One of those changes adds smart contract functionality to wallets, allowing wallet software developers to build new convenience-oriented features, like the ability to pay transaction fees in cryptocurrencies other than ether (ETH). \u200b\u200bTestnets act as copies of a main blockchain, and are used by developers to run through any major code changes in a low stakes environment, giving them a place to patch out any bugs before they reach mainnet. Hoodi was the last of three testnets to run through a simulation of Pectra. Developers previously agreed that if all went well on Wednesday, Pectra would be monitored for around 30 more days and then, finally, activated on Ethereum's mainnet. \u2014 Margaux Nijkerk Read more . HYPERLIQUID EASES TOKENS FOR DEFI: The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is among the biggest drivers of value accrual and revenue creation for crypto projects, but its complexity often leaves users tangled in a web of blockchains, bridges, wallets and tokens. A technical update by Hyperliquid is making that process easier for both developers and users, with the direct linking of tokens on HyperCore and HyperEVM platforms now being possible. HyperCore is its native platform for spot assets (think tokens you can trade directly), and HyperEVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) network that executes smart contracts on Ethereum. Tokens on HyperCore, dubbed \u201cCore spot,\u201d can be linked to their counterparts on HyperEVM and are called \u201cEVM spot.\u201d Once linked, users can transfer them using simple actions \u2014 like a \u201cspotSend\u201d on HyperCore or a standard ERC-20 transfer on HyperEVM. By letting tokens move directly between them \u2014 without a third-party intermediary \u2014 developers can create products that cut out the technical chops required to move assets, which is easy for heavy crypto users, but may be challenging for beginners. \u2014 Shaurya Malwa Read more . CELO MIGRATION to LAYER-2: The Celo blockchain's long-awaited plan of becoming an Ethereum layer-2 chain has been completed, ending an almost two-year process, the main organizations behind the network said Wednesday. The transition ends a long journey beginning back in July 2023 for the layer-1 blockchain that included a community vote in July 2024 and a fierce competition, won by Optimism , among layer-2 networks out to convince the Celo ecosystem to build with their technology. The improved network \u2014 like other layer 2s \u2014 offers faster and cheaper transactions on top of Ethereum's mainnet. The blockchain is powered by Optimism\u2019s OP Stack, a customizable framework that lets developers build layer-2 networks based off of Optimism\u2019s technology. According to Rene Reisberg, the CEO of the Celo Foundation, the migration is the first of its kind in the Ethereum ecosystem, and will probably be used as a blueprint for other EVM-compatible blockchains that are looking to become a layer-2 network. \u2014 Margaux Nijkerk Read more . BITCOIN DEFI FACES FORK DILEMMA: Bitcoin developers looking to expand the blockchain's decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities are likely to be considering zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, functionality that's not currently available and which require a so-called soft fork, or new version of the software, to introduce them. That's a problem, according Edan Yago, a Bitcoin veteran of over a decade and core contributor to smart contract operating system BitcoinOS (BOS). \"Forking a blockchain, especially one with $2 trillion worth of value on it, is like open-heart surgery,\" he told CoinDesk in an interview. ZK proofs are a cryptographic method of proving the validity of statements while maintaining privacy through not revealing any information about it. The functionality is not available in Bitcoin's software, but could be made so through proposed implementations like OP_CAT and OP_CTV. Yago said developers should be able to find ways of enabling them on Bitcoin without any kind of fork. \"The burden of proof is on developers to demonstrate that there is no other way of accomplishing this through clever engineering,\" he said. This is what BOS hopes to achieve through the BitSNARK, a Bitcoin rollup protocol that is part of the family of computing paradigms being developed to scale the original blockchain. These emerged following the introduction of BitVM by Robin Linus in October 2023 , which set out a framework for how Ethereum-like smart contracts could be enabled on Bitcoin. BitcoinOS has now open-sourced what Yago describes as a \"fully production-ready\" BitSNARK protocol, meaning developers now have access to ZK verification on Bitcoin and can connect it to other blockchains like Ethereum, Solana and Cardano. \u2014 Jamie Crawley Read more .

    "content": "A bizarre twist of AI tech and nostalgia is seeing memecoin enthusiasts issue, pump, and dump tokens themed after Studio Ghibli movies as a new AI art trend went viral in the past 24 hours. That\u2019s coming after OpenAI\u2019s newly r eleased 4o model \u2014 its most powerful image generation tool that spits out artwork based on specific user instructions and style guidelines, mimicking the characteristic vibe and style of artists and animators. Thursday\u2019s internet craze is specific to AI-generated images styled after the whimsical, hand-drawn charm of Studio Ghibli films, with fans flooding the web with selfies and landscapes with an eerie precision of the studio\u2019s My Neighbour Totoro and Spirited Away films. The hashtag #GhibliAI has since racked up millions of hits on X and Instagram. And crypto traders are now turning the trend into digital gold. A flurry of Ghibli-themed cryptocurrencies are doing the rounds on Ethereum and Solana blockchains, with \"ghiblification\" (GHIBLI) emerging as the biggest one yet with a $21 million market cap as of Asian morning hours. Inspired memecoins often go viral and tend to rack up bets because they tap into internet culture\u2019s love for humor, absurdity, and community. Their low entry cost and wild price swings draw speculators chasing quick gains, amplifying buzz. It has racked up nearly $70 million in trading volumes in just 24 hours of going live from a little over 250,000 individual trades. The token\u2019s liquidity pool has just over $330,000 worth of Solana\u2019s SOL (meaning the max a GHIBLI holder can exchange their holdings for, minus price declines). Smaller tokens such as Ghilbi Doge, a Studio Ghibli-inspired doge, and popular movie characters NoFace and Yutaro have inspired their tokens. However, these have not gained much traction among traders as of Asian afternoon hours.",

    "headline": "Ethereum Reclaims No. 1 Spot as Leading DEX Chain for First Time Since September, Overtakes Solana",
    "content": "Last month, Ethereum reclaimed its title as the leading smart contract blockchain for decentralized exchange (DEX) trading, as the market swoon dampened activity on Solana, the go-to platform for memecoin traders. Ethereum-based DEXes registered an industry-leading cumulative trading volume of $64.616 billion in March, beating Solana's tally of $52.62 billion by 22%, according to data source DefiLama . That's the first time since September that Ethereum topped the charts, pushing Solana to the number two spot. The change in leadership happened as the total crypto market capitalization fell 4.2% to $2.63 trillion, extending February's 20% loss, as macroeconomic uncertainty and disappointment over the lack of fresh BTC purchases in the U.S. strategic reserve saw bitcoin slip below $80,000. The bearish market sentiment dampened speculation across the broader landscape, especially within the memecoin sector, as reflected in the significant decline in activity on Raydium, the leading Solana-based DEX and a hotspot for meme trading in late 2024. Throughout March, Raydium did not log a single day with trading volume exceeding $1 billion, highlighting a considerable decrease from its record-high of $13 billion on Jan. 18, DefiLlama data show. Additionally, daily volume on the Solana-based memecoin launch pad averaged less than $100 million in March, down significantly from the peak of $390 million in mid-January. Activity on Solana-based DEXes peaked with the debut of President Donald Trump's TRUMP token in January. Meanwhile, Ethereum's outperformance was driven by Uniswap, which achieved over $30 billion in trading volume, with Fluid taking the distant second spot with $9 billion in activity. Still, Ethereum's ether token fell over 18% to $1,822 in March, registering bigger losses than Solana's SOL token, which fell by 15.8%, per data source TradingView and CoinDesk. Per observers , ether's inflationary tokenomics and the growing popularity of Layer 2 solutions, which supposedly siphon activity from the main chain, are responsible for ether's poor performance.",

    "headline": "0xbow's Ethereum Privacy Pools Surpass 200 Deposits as User Interest Grows",
    "content": "\"Tornado [Cash] is dead, but privacy won't die,\" an ether enthusiast said on X after Oxbow's Ethereum privacy tools went live on April 1 to facilitate on-chain privacy while dissociating from illicit funds. The sentiment is echoed by the early uptake for the privacy pools, which have processed 238 user deposit transactions, totaling 67.49 ETH in the first three days. The new tool has received a thumbs-up from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who was one of the first to deposit ETH . These privacy pools leverage zero-knowledge proofs and commitment schemes to facilitate ether deposits and subsequent withdrawals, in part or whole, while breaking the link between deposits and withdrawal addresses. Think of it like having a specialized bank account to send money while hiding your identity or how much money you have. The architecture comprises the contract layer for managing assets, the zero-knowledge layer to ensure privacy and the association set provider layer that ensures compliance by vetting funds. The three layers work together to preserve privacy while screening transactions for links to illicit actors such as hackers, phishers and scammers. The screening is dynamic, meaning a deposit is accepted but later found malicious, it can be removed. Privacy pools are non-custodial, ensuring users retain full control over their funds, allowing even rejected deposits to move back funds to their original addresses. As of now, the deposit limits are set between 0.1 ETH and 1 ETH, with the promise to increase the same after the initial battle testing period. \"This is only the beginning. The road to making privacy normal again is long and exciting, and we can\u2019t do it alone!\u201d 0xbow said on X.",

    "content": "Virgil Griffith, a former Ethereum developer jailed for attending a crypto conference in North Korea in 2019, was released from prison and is on his way to a halfway house, according to his lawyer, Alexander Urbelis. Urbelis, general counsel of the Ethereum Name Service who has also been serving as Griffith\u2019s outside counsel, posted a photo of the newly released Griffith and his parents on X on Wednesday, standing in front of FCI Milan, the low-security Michigan prison where Griffith served a portion of his 56-month sentence. \u201cI am so pleased to report that VIRGIL IS OUT!\u201d Urbelis wrote. \u201cHappy day indeed.\u201d Griffith was arrested in November 2019, seven months after returning from the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, where he had attended a crypto conference . While at the conference, Griffith gave a presentation on Ethereum and explained how cryptocurrency could be used to evade sanctions against the country. Though he initially fought the charge, Griffith pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate international sanctions in 2021. The New York judge overseeing the case sentenced him to a $100,000 fine and 63 months, or a little over five years, imprisonment \u2014 a fraction of the possible 20 year sentence he faced if he went to trial and lost. Last year, Griffith\u2019s lawyers were successfully able to get his sentence reduced to 56 months, citing his status as a first-time offender. Griffith has been imprisoned since mid-2021. Though he was initially released on bail following his arrest, a judge sent him back to jail in New York to await trial after he violated his bail conditions by attempting to access one of his cryptocurrency accounts in order to pay his lawyers. Urbelis told CoinDesk that Griffith\u2019s legal team has hopes he will soon be moved from his halfway house in Baltimore to home confinement. \u201cBut the long-term consequences persist: Virgil will have to endure burdensome probation for several years, the conditions of which are not yet known,\" Urbelis said. \"And on top of that, the Department of Commerce placed severe export restrictions on Virgil that will extend until 2032 and which would make his life very difficult.\u201d The Department of Commerce\u2019s restrictions prohibit Griffith from participating either directly or indirectly in any transaction involving software or technology that will be exported from the U.S., Urbelis said, making a return to working in the crypto industry difficult, if not impossible. Griffith is seeking a pardon from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, which Urbelis said was an \u201congoing process\u201d they had made \u201cgreat progress\u201d on. \u201cWe are seeking a pardon to bring justice to a prosecution that we believe was wrongheaded and fundamentally un-American from the outset, to better Virgil\u2019s life, and to make sure that Virgil has [the] ability to contribute to a world that so desperately needs thinkers and doers like him,\u201d Urbelis said. Trump has pardoned a number of people convicted on crypto-related criminal charges, including Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes and three people convicted of violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Still more convicted crypto criminals, including former FTX CEO and fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, are hopeful for pardons of their own.",

    "headline": "Can Ethereum Be Truly Private? Developers Push for Encrypted Mempool, Default Privacy",
    "content": "When the U.S. government sanctioned the Ethereum-based crypto mixing service Tornado Cash in 2022, it ignited a debate within the crypto community that continues three years later. Tornado enabled users to transfer crypto anonymously. The government contended that the service facilitated money laundering, prompting some of Ethereum's validators and block builders to take steps to avoid engaging with Tornado-linked transactions, which made the service slower and costlier to use. Advocates argued that complying with the sanctions amounted to censorship \u2014 undermining a fundamental cypherpunk principle. President Donald Trump supported the cypherpunks and lifted the sanctions on Tornado Cash in March of this year, but for some Ethereum developers, the situation highlighted a flaw within the network that still exists today: Why should users depend on third-party apps to transact privately on the network? \"Publicly accessible transaction graphs allow anyone to trace the flow of funds between accounts, and balances are visible to all participants in the network, undermining financial privacy,\" crypto security researcher Pascal Caversaccio explained in a blog post on Wednesday. \"While the Ethereum network's transparency fosters trustlessness, it also opens the door to potential surveillance, targeting, and exploitation.\" Perhaps emboldened by the recent Tornado Cash developments, Ethereum developers and researchers have once again begun discussing ideas for making the Ethereum network private at its core. \"Privacy must not be an optional feature that users must consciously enable \u2014 it must be the default state of the network,\" said Caversaccio, whose post outlined his vision for a privacy-oriented Ethereum roadmap. \"Ethereum's architecture must be designed to ensure that users are private by default, not by exception.\" Caversaccio's post identified several potential interventions \u2014 some new, some old \u2014 that could, according to him, would make Ethereum more private for end-users. One idea is to encrypt Ethereum's public mempool \u2014 where transactions are sent before they're recorded permanently. Another involves making Ethereum transactions confidential through zero-knowledge cryptography, new transaction formats, and other methods. \"Today, Ethereum operates in a partial, opt-in privacy model, where users must take deliberate steps to conceal their financial activities \u2014 often at the cost of usability, accessibility, and even effectiveness,\" wrote Caversaccio. \"This paradigm must shift. Privacy-preserving technologies should be deeply integrated at the protocol level, allowing transactions, smart contracts, and network interactions to be inherently confidential.\" In response to Caversaccio's post, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin left a comment on the network's main developer forum with his own much shorter privacy-oriented Ethereum roadmap. Buterin suggested focusing on privacy for on-chain payments, anonymizing on-chain activity within applications, making communication on the network anonymous, and privatizing on-chain reads. To achieve all of this, Buterin listed various steps like integrating certain third-party privacy features into the core network. One of the more substantial interventions suggested by Buterin involves moving the network towards a \u201cone address per application\u201d model \u2014 a departure from today's system, where a single application may employ dozens of wallets for different features. \u201cThis is a major step, and it entails significant convenience sacrifices, but IMO this is a bullet that we should bite, because this is the most practical way to remove public links between all of your activity across different applications,\u201d Buterin wrote. According to Buterin, if all of his suggestions are implemented, private transactions could be the default on Ethereum. The privacy discussion comes a few weeks before Ethereum\u2019s next major upgrade , Pectra, which doesn\u2019t have a major focus on privacy. Ethereum developers are also currently planning the network\u2019s following upgrade to Fusaka. The changes to be included in that hard fork are not yet set in stone.

    "headline": "Inside \u2018An Ethereum Story\u2019: Filming Vitalik Buterin, Crypto\u2019s Most Reluctant Star",
    "content": "Vitalik Buterin, the original creator of the Ethereum blockchain, is one of the most recognizable figures of the cryptocurrency industry. He\u2019s often admired in the ecosystem for being highly technical while also deeply philosophical about technology's role in society. For those that do not follow crypto closely, Buterin starkly contrasts the stereotypical image of a flashy cryptocurrency billionaire with his minimalism in his personal style as well as his geeky and awkward mannerisms. The documentary \u201cVitalik: An Ethereum Story,\u201d which is set for global release April 15, tries to give us a peek into those aspects of Buterin, following his early life and childhood in Russia followed by immigrating with his family to Toronto, Canada, where his love for computers and technology began in his high school years. At the core of Buterin\u2019s life was the creation of Ethereum, which came after his early involvement in Toronto\u2019s Bitcoin community, where he saw the potential of the asset in giving people some financial freedom. While thinking how he could apply those concepts to other aspects of life, Buterin set out to write a whitepaper on creating the blockchain version of the internet. Toronto has strong ties to Ethereum\u2019s early days. It was home to some of the first Ethereum developer hackathons and meetups organized by Ethereum\u2019s Canadian co-founders in the city. This year, CoinDesk\u2019s Consensus 2025 takes place in Toronto May 14-16, highlighting Canada\u2019s vibrant crypto community. The film walks through the various stages of Ethereum\u2019s lifetime, including the start of the network and the struggles Buterin faced in his new leadership role, the boom of the blockchain during the NFT era, the importance of the Merge in reducing Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption, and Buterin\u2019s urge to help Ukraine in its war with Russia by deploying crypto for resources. CoinDesk sat down with the directors of the documentary, Chris Temple and Zach Ingrasci, to hear about their perspectives on creating the film, ahead of its global release. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. CoinDesk: Why did you want to make a documentary about Ethereum? Zach Ingrasci [ZI]: So Chris and I have been making documentaries together for 15 years now. We make character driven documentaries. So I really love those human stories that give us insight into the emotions and motivations of people in really interesting places. We aren't crypto experts. We both studied economics, so we have a bit of understanding of finance. But when we met Vitalik in 2021 I think he immediately clicked something in our brains like: \u201coh, here's a story that kind of breaks the stereotypes that mainstream audiences have of this space.\u201d Quickly after meeting Vitalik, we did an NFT crowdfund for the film on mirror.xyz, peoplepleaser did the NFT. We raised basically the full budget of the film, and it allowed us to create this independent story and approach to follow Vitalik around the world, as, he lives out of a 40 liter backpack How did you guys decide what parts of Ethereum\u2019s history to include in Vitalik\u2019s story? One noticeable moment I thought was interesting that you left out was not to include the 2016 DAO hack? Why exclude that key moment in Ethereum\u2019s history but leave in other moments? ZI: This is the challenge of making these films. We had a very broad mandate, following the community, not just focused on Vitalik. And then after two years of filming, we realized that the kind of narrative structure would only make sense if you were able to follow one person and then get to meet the community through his eyes. The DAO hack is very confusing to explain, and so there's an element of just what at its essence is important. And I think, you know, the moment for Vitalik to decide whether the Ethereum Foundation would be nonprofit versus for profit is a very understandable concept for a mainstream audience. They get it. As you mentioned, there was the premiere a few months ago, and it was only accessible to people on-chain. If the movie is aimed for a mainstream audience, why first decide to release it on-chain, instead of a streaming platform where more of those folks can access it? ZI: It\u2019s a practical answer. The documentary industry is broken, so to have an independent film premiere on a mainstream platform doesn't even mean anything, unless you have real marketing. And so actually, the on-chain release, the NFT, the trailer release on Zora, building sponsorship for this mainstream release is critical. Chris Temple [CT]: People love the film, and have rallied behind it and been interested and been sharing it with their moms, being like: \u201cHey, this is what I do for a living.\u201d This isn't just our film, this film belongs to the community. And I think empowering people with it at that first step, and using the technology that the film was all about felt very right to us. How did you convince Vitalik to do the film? He\u2019s not very rerceptive to the media so how did you get him to agree to do it? ZI: I think we got really lucky in some ways. This was before he was on the front page of TIME magazine . I think he was motivated to speak up about what he believed the future of Ethereum should look like, and how to build it, and people should focus on building things that have real world value. So I think we just happened to meet him at the perfect moment when he and the people around him were looking to have access to broader audiences. I think ultimately, that's what makes for us Vitalik the perfect participant of a film, because his reluctance to be in that spotlight, that genuine authenticity. You can tell on the film that he's not trying to hog the spotlight. This is something that he's uncomfortable with, and something that's taken a long journey for him to even find where his voice is and how it should be. CT: It was a very challenging production, more than any film we've ever made, because Vitalik is nomadic, he\u2019s all over the world, and he says, \u201cI'm going to be tomorrow in Montenegro\u2026If you want to come.\u201d We have to immediately try to scramble and get everybody there just to get those moments, even if it's just a couple of hours with Vitalik. Recently, there\u2019s been a bunch of leadership changes at the EF, and Vitalik has been at the core of making the decision on those changes. The movie shows how uncomfortable Vitalik can be in stepping into that leadership role and having to make core decisions like whether the EF should be a non-profit vs for-profit organization and going against some co-founders. Given all the key decisions he\u2019s had to make over the past few months and a key leader in Ethereum, what do you think went through his mind, and has he become more comfortable in his leadership role? ZI: I really can't speak for Vitalik, but I do think that's why this film has never been more relevant. Because if we are looking for insight into how Vitalik thinks and what he cares about, I think the thing he cares most about is that Ethereum will be useful in the world. There's an important quote in the film about \u201cif Ethereum is only used for speculation, that's a huge missed opportunity.\u201d So it's not surprising that Vitalik didn\u2019t go to the White House [to meet with President Trump]. Vitalik cares about how this tool will be used in the long term for real, positive change in the world. He is uncomfortable with conflict, we know that, we see that in the film. So I can't imagine this has been an easy process for him. But you can definitely tell that he's begun to understand how to use his voice in this ecosystem and use his kind of soft power. Read more: Ethereum Foundation Picks New Co-Executive Directors, Following Leadership Reshuffle What was filming in Ukraine during the start of the Russian invasion like? And why does Vitalik feel so connected to that cause? ZI: We have some experience filming on the borders of war zones. Luckily, at that time Kiev was relatively safe. It really was Vitalik's idea, he always wanted to support the hackers there. Vitalik just felt like he could be there to support them, and it's something he cares so deeply about for two reasons: 1) he actually has Ukrainian ancestry, and 2) coming from Russia, I think he regrets having met with Putin. Then there\u2019s also just really one of the first concrete examples of real positive impact in the world, of how crypto is being used when the banking system was in chaos, and so quickly got money to the front lines. There's a deleted scene where he's playing chess with Fedorov, the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine. But you know, Fedorov was talking about how 1000s of their military were saved because of that $100 million Vitalik raised in crypto was quickly mobilized. What are you hoping that your audience takes away from this film? CT: Documentaries are bad at information, but they're great at provoking questions and getting emotions. If we can inspire an audience to be more savvy and think more critically about technology, not just in these extremes of it's all bad or it's all good, but to understand a bit of that spectrum along the middle there, and look at both the positive and negative consequences of technology. I think that kind of techno optimism is the core of what this film is really about. Helping anybody apply those lessons, whether it's within crypto, within AI, because technology is just going to continue to shift and impact our lives. The movie is about Vitalik as a person but also a bit about Ethereum\u2019s history. So is Vitalik = Ethereum? ZI: I don't think he is, and I think that's what he hoped for at this point. I hope that comes across in the film, and that's why we called it an Ethereum story, because I think it\u2019s one of many that gets told. I think that's where Vitalik has been successful because he is not Ethereum.",

    "headline": "Ethereum Is What Bitcoin Was Meant to Be",
    "content": "Bitcoin was born as a response to institutional failure, a decentralized escape hatch from corruptible centralized finance and a north star of self sovereignty. Bitcoin\u2019s true vision was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system . That phrase is right there in the Bitcoin white paper\u2019s title from Satoshi himself. You're reading Crypto Long & Short , our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Today, Bitcoin is many things: A store of value A form of digital gold A macro asset But Bitcoin is not electronic cash. It is too volatile for daily use, too slow to scale and too rigid to adapt as a cash equivalent. Somewhere along the way, Bitcoin gave up on being the system, and instead became the signal. Ethereum, by contrast, might be the one actually delivering on Bitcoin\u2019s original promise. Thanks to Ethereum\u2019s programmability, we now have stablecoins , arguably the most successful crypto use case to date. Dollar-backed tokens like USDC and USDT settle trillions in peer-to-peer value across borders 24/7 with no bank intermediaries. Stablecoins are Bitcoin\u2019s white paper come to life , minus the volatility. Ethereum\u2019s scale can be shown through on-chain data. Stablecoins on Ethereum and its Layer 2s now rival the transaction volume of major credit and debit card networks. In markets where local currencies are unstable or financial access is limited, stablecoins have become lifelines. They are used for remittances, payroll, savings and even commerce. The irony is that Bitcoin wanted to replace fiat, but it\u2019s Ethereum that has quietly made fiat better. It gave the dollar superpowers like composability, programmability and global mobility. And it\u2019s doing it without centralized permission. Here\u2019s the kicker: Ethereum\u2019s evolution doesn\u2019t stop at payments. Once you understand the technology, you realize ETH does everything BTC can do, and so much more. Where Bitcoin remains focused on scarcity, Ethereum is building infrastructure. The rise of real-world asset tokenization ( RWAs ) is a perfect example. Treasury bills, private credit and fund shares are now being issued on Ethereum, bringing regulated assets into composable finance. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and other legacy giants aren\u2019t launching on Bitcoin; they\u2019re building on Ethereum. Additionally, unlike Bitcoin\u2019s inert capital, Ethereum enables native yield through staking, allowing participants to secure the network while earning predictable returns \u2014 an increasingly attractive feature for institutions seeking on-chain cash flow. This isn\u2019t to say Bitcoin has failed. It serves a different role: a monetary anchor in the digital world. But its utility is limited. Ethereum, on the other hand, is becoming the global settlement layer for on-chain assets . While Bitcoin adoption has captured mainstream headlines, Ethereum\u2019s fundamentals quietly continue to grow as the platform gains institutional market share. Some metrics to back up Ethereum\u2019s growing influence and usage include: Developer activity Stablecoin usage Real-world adoption Ethereum isn\u2019t replacing Bitcoin. But it\u2019s fulfilling what Bitcoin started: a decentralized, global financial system with open access and programmable trust \u2014 in short, digital cash. Bitcoin sparked the movement. But Ethereum is scaling it. For further information, please click here to view Advantage Blockchain\u2019s last quarterly report.",

    "headline": "Vitalik Buterin Proposes Replacing Ethereum\u2019s EVM With RISC-V",
    "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared a new proposal over the weekend that would radically overhaul the system that powers its smart contracts. Buterin's suggestion, which he posted on Ethereum's primary developer forum, involves replacing the Ethereum Virtual Machine , the software engine that powers programs on the network, with RISC-V, a popular open-source framework that offers built-in encryption and other benefits. . The EVM is a key piece of Ethereum's underlying design and has been seen as one of the main elements that helped the network succeed in a crowded field of other blockchains. Many non-Ethereum networks have used the EVM to build their own chains, as has a growing ecosystem of layer-2 networks built atop Ethereum, including Coinbase's Base chain. The EVM has long played an essential role in Ethereum's development. Other chains that use it can seamlessly connect with apps on Ethereum, and developers on EVM-based networks can transition more smoothly to building applications directly within the Ethereum ecosystem. Buterin argued that transitioning Ethereum to a RISC-V architecture will \u201cgreatly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum execution layer, resolving one of the primary scaling bottlenecks, and can also greatly improve the execution layer\u2019s simplicity.\u201d (The execution layer is the part of the network that reads smart contracts.) The RISC-V architecture, which has seen limited adoption in other blockchain ecosystems, like Polkadot , could offer \"efficiency gains over 100x\" for certain kinds of applications, according to Buterin. These improvements could reduce the network's costs \u2014 long seen as a major barrier to adoption. Among the primary benefits of RISC-V is its native support for certain kinds of encryption. Transitioning to the new architecture could, in Buterin's view, be a simpler alternative to the community's current plan, which involves rebuilding the EVM around zero-knowledge cryptography. Buterin\u2019s proposal is something developers would tackle over the long term, comparable to projects like the Beam Chain , which is looking to revamp Ethereum\u2019s consensus layer. The RISC-V comes at a time of broader soul-searching for the Ethereum community. Recently, transaction volumes have declined, and Ethereum's token has lagged behind the broader market. Earlier this year, the Ethereum Foundation, the primary non-profit that supports the development of the broader Ethereum ecosystem, underwent a leadership transition in an attempt to remedy the impression among community members that the ecosystem lacked a clear roadmap and was losing its lead compared to competitors.

    "headline": "Ethereum Could Supercharge Transaction Speed to 2,000 TPS Thanks to Bold New Proposal",
    "content": "Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist on Sunday filed the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 9698, a plan to let the blockchain\u2019s gas limit grow on autopilot over the next four years. Feist is best known in crypto circles for his efforts in scaling the Ethereum network. The \u201cdanksharding\u201d element of the network\u2019s Dencun update was named after him. The EIP introduces a deterministic \u201cexponential\u201d schedule baked into client defaults, which nudges the gas limit upward by a tiny preset amount every epoch. These predictable gas limit increases allow current validators to keep their machines up to speed, cutting the need for sudden upgrades. If approved and implemented, the gas limit ceiling would climb from 36 million units to roughly 3.6 billion, allowing an estimated 6,000 simple transfers per block and over 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). Ethereum's current TPS is around 15-20 TPS. Client teams would still need to ship the code and leave the setting on by default, while operators could manually override it. \u201cThe current gas limit mechanism relies on miner/operator voting, which lacks coordination and predictability,\u201d Feist wrote in a Github post as the motivation behind the proposal. \u201cWhile flexible, this approach can lead to stagnation or overly cautious increases.\u201d \u201cBy introducing a predictable exponential growth pattern as a client default, this EIP encourages a sustainable and transparent gas limit trajectory, aligned with expected advancements in hardware and protocol efficiency,\u201d Feist added. The proposal sets an activation point at Beacon-chain epoch 369017, roughly June 1. An epoch lasts 6.4 minutes and consists of 32 slots, each containing a block, which stores data and adds to the chain. EIP-9698 now awaits review by client maintainers and core developers. If they flip the switch this June, Ethereum\u2019s throughput curve could look very different by 2029\u2014no hard fork required. The proposal comes as Ethereum faces competition from a bloated landscape of blockchains that offer faster settlement times and significantly lower fees. In recent years, this has led to an exodus of financial activity and users to other networks. Read more: Vitalik Buterin Proposes Replacing Ethereum\u2019s EVM With RISC-V",

    "headline": "The Next Ethereum Will Come From a Dorm Room (or a College Dropout)",
    "content": "Before Ethereum had a market cap, it was just an idea in a college dropout\u2019s head. Crypto\u2019s biggest companies aren\u2019t being planned in boardrooms. They\u2019re being built in dorm rooms, group chats, and hackathons by founders who don\u2019t wait for permission (many of them don\u2019t finish college at all). This is not a coincidence. It\u2019s a repeat of a pattern we\u2019ve seen before: bold ideas, early action, and zero regard for institutional timelines. In 2014, a group of students launched the Blockchain Education Network (BEN) to connect students exploring bitcoin and blockchain across college campuses. Within a year, BEN had grown to over 160 chapters in more than 35 countries. What started as grassroots education quickly became a launchpad for builders. BEN became a catalyst for its core members and for a global cohort of students who saw crypto as a blank canvas. Some dropped out. Others stayed in. Nearly all started building before the rest of the world caught on. Projects fostered by that ecosystem have gone on to collectively reach over $20 billion in peak valuations, including IOTA, Optimism, Bitso, Augur, Wanchain, Notional and Roll. That same spirit of early action led me and Erick Pinos, former president of MIT\u2019s Bitcoin Club, to co-found Dropout Capital, backing young, technical founders who move before the world notices. Erick Pinos will speak at Consensus 2025 on May 16 in a panel titled \u201cThe Talent Pipeline: How to Find a Job in Crypto.\u201d As Pinos puts it: \u201cOver the past seven years we\u2019ve met with countless student founders and at least half a dozen have become unicorns\u2026we\u2019re excited to give others the opportunity to be a part of funding the next generation of blockchain innovation.\u201d This urgency isn\u2019t new. It\u2019s the same drive that shaped early tech giants. Steve Jobs (Apple), Steve Wozniak (Apple), Jack Dorsey (Twitter, Square), and Patrick & John Collison (Stripe) all left college behind to build companies that redefined their industries. Web3 founders are following the same path Some of crypto\u2019s most influential founders started the same way: \u2022 Vitalik Buterin dropped out of the University of Waterloo to launch Ethereum (peaked at $500 billion+) \u2022 Charles Hoskinson left the University of Colorado before founding Cardano (peaked at $70 billion) \u2022 Jed McCaleb, co-founder of Ripple and Stellar, dropped out of UC Berkeley (Ripple peaked at $130 billion) \u2022 Jesse Powell left Cal State to build Kraken (valued at $10 billion) \u2022 Shayne Coplan dropped out of NYU in his first semester to start Polymarket (estimated at $1 billion) \u2022 Joey Krug left Pomona to co-found Augur (peaked at $1 billion) \u2022 Jeremy Gardner, who co-founded Augur with Krug, dropped out of the University of Michigan (peaked at $1 billion) \u2022 Jinglan Wang left Wellesley to build Eximchain and later helped lead Optimism (peaked at $11 billion+) \u2022 Noah Tweedale, co-founder of Pump.fun, never enrolled (estimated at $1 billion+) At Dropout Capital, we\u2019ve backed early-stage companies including: \u2022 Vana, founded at MIT, building a decentralized data marketplace \u2022 SatLayer, started by MIT alumni and former VCs, creating Bitcoin-native compute for AI \u2022 Tenderize, launched by students at Marquette University, building a liquid staking marketplace \u2022 Algebra.Finance, founded by a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a background in mobile operating systems, rethinking on-chain prediction infrastructure One place where these stories, and the stories of the next generation are already being shared is ChainStories, a podcast I host alongside Erick. ChainStories takes listeners behind the scenes of some of the most successful projects in crypto, including Plume Network, YesNoError, Algebra.Finance, Virtuals.io, TON, Horizon Labs, and many others, breaking down how real companies are built from idea to launch, and helping founders and VCs understand the decisions, tradeoffs, and risks that happen long before anyone notices. The future of crypto isn\u2019t being theorized at conferences or slow-walked through corporate committees. It\u2019s being built by people who move early, take risks, and start building before the world even realizes what\u2019s happening. And, if history is any guide, the companies that matter most won\u2019t be the ones that waited.",

    "content": "Ethereum developers are preparing for Wednesday's much anticipated Pectra upgrade , set to bring the biggest code change to the blockchain since the Merge in 2022. Pectra \u2013 a blend of the names Prague + Electra \u2013 consists of two upgrades happening on Ethereum\u2019s consensus and execution layers at the same time. The upgrade is focused on making the Ethereum blockchain more user-friendly and efficient. Pectra consists of 11 major code changes , or \"Ethereum improvement proposals\" (EIPs), that will improve the staking experience on the network, introduce new wallet features, and update the functionality of the blockchain. One of the main changes coming to the blockchain is EIP-7702, which gives wallets smart contract capabilities , moving them towards a technological trend known as \u201caccount abstraction.\u201d The change will allow wallets to add user-friendly features, like the ability to pay gas fees with currencies other than ether (ETH.) Another major change, known as EIP-7251, will make the staking experience for validators easier. After Pectra, validators will be able to increase the maximum amount of ETH they can stake from 32 to 2,048, meaning those who stake across multiple validators can now consolidate them under one node. This should mean that it will take less time to spin up a new node and alleviate the cumbersome experience of setting up the equipment. Some of the changes in Pectra have been planned for a few years, even though developers originally targeted this all to go live in 2024. However, due to the complexities of the code changes, Pectra was delayed until the first quarter of 2025. After the initial delay, developers tested the upgrade twice on two different testnets and both networks experienced bugs, requiring the developers to create a third test, delaying the upgrade once again. \u201cThe Pectra fork is coming to Ethereum mainnet soon! Please don't forget to update your nodes,\u201d wrote Ethereum Foundation devops engineer Parithosh Jayanthi on X .

    "headline": "Sei Wants to Cut Cosmos Compatibility and Go All-In on Ethereum",
    "content": "A Sei Network developer proposed to depreciate the blockchain\u2019s Cosmos support on Wednesday in a bid to remove \u201cunnecessary\u201d complexity for users. The proposal, if successful, will make it so Sei users will only be able to send and receive transactions that are compatible with Ethereum. Cutting Cosmos support will significantly simplify the blockchain, reduce infrastructure overhead, and position Sei more strongly within the broader Ethereum ecosystem, Philip Su, Sei Labs\u2019 Engineering Lead, said in the proposal. \u201cThis transition will lead to greater adoption, improved developer experience, and a more cohesive community,\u201d he said. The move comes as blockchain infrastructure builders compete to draw in developers and expand their orbits. Ethereum-based infrastructure, which runs on software called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, is what the majority of decentralized finance apps run on. Ethereum, as well as other big blockchains like Coinbase\u2019s Base and the Binance-affiliated BNB Chain, all use the EVM. But there are challengers. Solana uses its own software called the Solana Virtual Machine, or SVM, while Cosmos has pioneered software called CosmWasm. Sei currently supports both EVM and CosmWasm. \u201cWhile this dual architecture has provided flexibility, it also introduces significant complexity and friction for both users and developers,\u201d Su said. If Sei pivots away from CosmWasm it could be a significant blow for the software\u2019s adoption. The Sei Network has grown steadily since its 2023 launch. Deposits to DeFi apps on the network are at an all-time high of $1 billion, according to DefiLlama data , making it the 15th largest blockchain by total value locked. Barry Plunkett, co-CEO of Interchain Labs, the development and growth team for Cosmos, told CoinDesk that even if Sei cuts Cosmos support, it is still a Cosmos-based blockchain. Users and developers will still be able to take advantage of some Cosmos features, like staking and governance, he said. Unnecessary overhead When Sei launched it didn\u2019t support the EVM and adoption was slow. Over the blockchain\u2019s first year it only attracted some $50 million of deposits to its DeFi apps, a paltry sum compared to other blockchains that launched around the same time, such as Sui, which soared above $600 million in deposits during its first year. But that changed in July 2024 when Sei launched its second version, which let users create DeFi apps using either CosmWasm or the EVM. Activity exploded as developers and investors flocked to the blockchain. Among DeFi developers, the EVM is the most well-known software. So by introducing EVM support, Sei was able to tap into a much larger pool of developers. New Sei users are now predominantly choosing to use the EVM instead of CosmWasm, data compiled by Sei Labs on data platform Dune Analytics shows. What\u2019s more, the current cross-compatibility comes at a cost, Su said. It introduces \u201cunnecessary overhead in the codebase and complicates debugging and testing,\u201d he said. Still, there\u2019s no guarantee others in the Sei community will feel the same way. Build with Sei, a group managed by the nonprofit Sei Foundation, will host a call on May 14 to discuss the proposal in detail and give opportunities for developers and the community to ask questions and give feedback.

    "content": "After the successful deployment last week of Pectra, Ethereum's biggest upgrade in more than a year, the network's core developers are already shifting focus to the next major chain upgrade: Fusaka. Pectra, the biggest code change to Ethereum since the Merge in 2022, introduced key changes aimed at making staking easier for institutions, improving wallet accessibility, and boosting transaction efficiency. Developers have already begun planning for Fusaka, the network\u2019s next upgrade, and have thus far agreed to include an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) called \"PeerDAS\" that could help the network support larger \"blobs\" of transaction data. Blobs, introduced during the Dencun upgrade, are dedicated spaces for large chunks of data related to transactions. They are stored off-chain, which reduces congestion on the Ethereum blockchain and lowers gas fees. The blobs are crucial for the growing layer-2 ecosystem built on top of Ethereum, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Coinbase's Base, which process transactions more quickly and at lower costs than the main chain. PeerDAS, which stands for Peer Data Availability Sampling, would let validators download partial data from blobs instead of full blobs to validate whether the data has been posted to the network. In theory, PeerDAS could reduce layer-2 transaction costs and benefit institutions operating validators on the Ethereum blockchain. \u201cPeerDAS is super important since we want to help layer-2s scale,\u201d said Parithosh Jayanti, a devops engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, to CoinDesk over Telegram. \u201cPeerDAS allows us to bump the blob limit significantly.\" Fusaka is scheduled to go live at the end of 2025 and will eventually include a bundle of additional upgrades beyond PeerDAS. However, Ethereum developers are notorious for delaying their upgrades. Pectra was initially set for release at the end of 2024 but was postponed to the first quarter of 2025. After a few faulty tests , the developers further delayed the upgrade to May. Ethereum developers have been criticized over the past year for not implementing protocol changes quickly enough. As the price of the network\u2019s token has lagged in recent months and developers have migrated to competing ecosystems, the chain's community has debated whether its unofficial leader \u2014 the non-profit Ethereum Foundation \u2014 is to blame.

    "content": "Crypto insurer Chainproof announced a new product Wednesday that lets Ethereum stakers protect against slashing and guarantees them a minimum yearly yield. Slashing, while rare, is a big concern for stakers. It\u2019s a feature that keeps the validators who process transactions on Ethereum in check by taking away some of their tokens if they publish incorrect data. Most slashing happens due to code bugs in validator software or human error, not because validators try to attack or cheat the system. Chainproof\u2019s product, which involves a partnership with insurance broker IMA Financial Group, will top up stakers\u2019 yield if slashing causes their returns to fall below the Composite Ether Staking Rate, or CESR, a benchmark rate that represents the mean, annualized staking yield generated by all Ethereum validators. CESR was created by CoinDesk Indices (a CoinDesk subsidiary) and CoinFund. \"As staking takes center stage across a new generation of ETFs and other institutional financial products, it will be imperative for institutions to insure that yield,\u201d Chris Perkins, President of CoinFund, a partner behind the CESR benchmark, told CoinDesk. Staking is the act of locking up tokens on a blockchain to help validate transactions, earning a reward from the network for the stakers. Ethereum stakers can earn around 3.5% annually. Slashing risk Since Ethereum started allowing users to stake in 2020, validators have been slashed 474 times, according to beaconcha.in data . In one high-profile incident in 2023, Bitcoin Suisse, a company that provides staking services for institutional clients, lost almost $200,000 after 100 of its newly set up validators were slashed. The financial damage caused by slashing on Ethereum is small compared to hacks or DeFi protocol bugs. Still, many crypto security researchers worry that an event where thousands of validators are simultaneously slashed is a serious risk. Chainproof\u2019s offering isn\u2019t the first insurance product for Ethereum stakers. Nexus Mutual, a crypto insurance alternative, offers coverage that pays out on each individual slashing incident and covers losses up to a predetermined amount. However, it does not guarantee yearly returns. Chainproof\u2019s insurance differs in that it will reimburse losses of 95% to 98% of the CESR benchmark rate over a one-year period. If their total earned staking rewards fall below this level, the policy automatically reimburses them, guaranteeing the amount of rewards they will receive. It\u2019s a small difference, but one that Chainproof\u2019s customers say is needed for institutional crypto adoption at scale, Don Ho, the firm\u2019s co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk. The firm will launch its staking coverage on June 1 with early access programs for large-scale validators and institutional staking providers. Several companies involved in Ethereum staking, including Blockdaemon, Pier Two, Globalstake, and P2P, already plan to offer Chainproof\u2019s coverage to their clients.

While Di Iorio is still a big Bitcoin proponent, he has said that \u201cI do think eventually Ethereum has a possibility of overtaking it in terms of market capitalization.\u201d \u201cWith the amount of use cases, and the value that Ethereum is allowing to be created, I think it has that opportunity, in order to possibly overtake it,\u201d Di Iorio added. After stepping away from the Ethereum Foundation, Anthony Di Iorio founded Decentral in 2014, which is best known for creating the Jaxx Liberty crypto wallet. In 2022, he launched Andiami, a project blending hardware , tokenomics, and game theory to tackle centralization vectors within decentralized networks.

    "headline": "Ethereum Backers Respond to Critics: \u2018Markets Will Catch Up\u2019",
    "content": "TORONTO \u2014 Ethereum just completed its most significant upgrade in more than a year, but the milestone comes after a turbulent stretch for the blockchain. The price of ether (ETH) has declined, developers have migrated to rival platforms, and the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 a nonprofit steward of the project \u2014 has faced criticism for a lack of coordination and vision. Speaking on a panel at CoinDesk\u2019s Consensus conference in Toronto, Paul Brody \u2014 global blockchain leader at EY and chairman of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance \u2014 and Josh Stark of the Ethereum Foundation, offered a more optimistic view of the road ahead. There are two things the community is looking for, Stark said. First, \u201cthe ecosystem needs stronger leadership \u2026 Stronger leadership on the roadmap, on executing that roadmap, and really help coordinating the ecosystem to tackle the big challenges.\u201d Second, the network needs better messaging. \u201cEthereum's fundamentals are incredibly strong, but few people are standing up to tell the story of that ecosystem and to boost the incredible stuff being built,\u201d Stark said. For all its recent struggles, Stark and Brody maintained that Ethereum remains the most innovative and forward-focused project in crypto. Brody suggested that concerns about the foundation\u2019s leadership are particularly overblown, giving the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s former executive director, Aya Miyaguchi, top marks for her tenure, which began in 2018 and ended this year. \u201cEthereum is a proof-of-stake chain with more than 120 layer-2 networks,\u201d said Broday. Network capacity, he added, is near \"300 and 450 million transactions a day.\" Additionally, \"transaction fees at the L2 level \u2014 they average under one penny per transaction for the last three months,\" said Brody. \"If I step back and look at [Miyaguchi's] tenure very objectively in terms of the results, I would say A plus.\u201d Miyaguchi transitioned to Ethereum Foundation president in March 2025, installing Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Sta\u0144czak as its new co-executive directors \u2014 part of a leadership restructuring aimed at enhancing the foundation's strategic focus. Some critics have argued Ethereum\u2019s roadmap has relied too heavily on layer-2 rollups \u2014 independent blockchains that process transactions cheaply and quickly before \"settling\" their history on Ethereum\u2019s main chain. Brody defended the network's rollup-centric roadmap: \u201cI'm delighted,\u201d he said. While layer-2s like Optimism, Arbitrum and Coinbase's Base network have lowered users' fees \u2014 generally considered the main headwind to wider network adoption \u2014 skeptics say they also introduce new security risks and fragmentation hurdles that threaten Ethereum's fundamental value proposition. \u201cEthereum is being Ethereum,\u201d Brody said. \u201cWhich is, identify a problem, fix it, and move on to the next problem. In terms of the biggest problem that we were dealing with over the last few years, it was scale, right? Going from being able to do a million transactions a day to 450 million network capacity is great.\u201d \u201cAll ecosystems are going to end up with something like an L2 roadmap with modularity and specialization,\u201d Stark added. \u201cWe're just the ones that have gone furthest down this path, and we found the twists and the turns and the challenges on that road, and we're dealing with them.\u201d Ether (ETH), the network\u2019s native token, has long been considered a blue-chip crypto asset. But in recent months, it has underperformed relative to some competitors. Network tokens are often viewed as a proxy for an ecosystem\u2019s overall health. Bitcoin, Stark noted, has successfully positioned itself as a reliable store of value, helping it weather the market more favorably than Ethereum. \u201cEthereum has a more complicated narrative,\u201d he said. Still, Stark expressed confidence that the market would eventually reflect Ethereum\u2019s deeper value. \u201cThe world's not going to stop learning about these technologies and these systems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is going to have an appetite for a slightly more complicated, but just as real value proposition. And I think we're starting to see that now. So I think that markets eventually price value. And I think that Ethereum is the most important project in crypto and always has been.\u201d",

    "headline": "Bitcoin Is the Asset, Ethereum Is the Platform",
    "content": "Blockchains are a technical marvel, but in this vastly competitive landscape, I\u2019ve come to see the social consensus and ecosystem around blockchains as by far their most important strategic asset. The social layer matters, but for different reasons depending on the chain. Specifically, I have the hypothesis that the \u201cLayer 0\u201d for any blockchain ecosystem can only excel at one primary mission. When I say \u201cLayer 0,\u201d what I am really talking about are the communities of people that sustain these networks. They are everyone from enthusiasts to engineers, developers, investors, venture capitalists and volunteers. As public networks that are built with open-source code, the strength of each ecosystem is primarily the community around it. Despite their superficial similarities, the communities and the ecosystems that underpin bitcoin and Ethereum are radically different. I have long said that \u201cbitcoin is the asset. Ethereum is the platform.\u201d In both cases, the social consensus around these blockchains is what keeps them together and makes each one ideally suited for its mission. Bitcoin first. Bitcoin is a scarcity-based store-of-value. Better than fiat currency. More reliably scarce than gold. Immune to politics and protected by a vast proof of work infrastructure. Bitcoin is in a constant battle for mindshare with other crypto-assets and, even more so, against traditional fiat currencies and central-bank-issued assets. This is not the same as other stores-of-value. There can be many kinds of government and corporate debt, and their values are all tied to the likelihood of repayment. The closest analogy for bitcoin is with gold, which does not pay interest or generate any cash flow. Nor is there any meaningful industrial demand for gold. The value of gold is simply that it is scarce and getting more of it is not easy. One particularly important feature of this crypto ecosystem is that it is a zero-sum game. If you admit that there can be more than one cryptocurrency used as a store of value, you are on a slippery slope because technically, there can be an infinite supply of identical copies of bitcoin. If there can be two, there can be a thousand. If that happens, the value of bitcoin is uncertain and likely low. Right now, there are no other cryptocurrencies that have a value even remotely close to that of bitcoin. Assets like litecoin, bitcoin cash, dogecoin and others represent a tiny fraction of bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization. The only asset in the same general league is ether, and I would argue that it should be seen less as a cryptocurrency and more as a stake in a computing ecosystem. The result of this logic is a uniquely aggressive approach to mindshare. The value of bitcoin must be sustained by constant memetic warfare against other cryptocurrencies. Scroll through r/bitcoin, and you will find a stream of memes that aim to reinforce the value of bitcoin. Typical content includes dire warnings about the U.S. dollar\u2019s debasement with quantitative easing, the serious U.S. federal debt, the horrors of inflation, and rapturous predictions for future prices. That quantitative easing did not cause inflation and that low to moderate inflations inflict no measurable economic harm does not matter in that context: Political harm, yes, economic harm no. (See here and here ) A typical bitcoin meme includes a reminder that a long, long time ago, a dollar would buy you a full bag of groceries. The implication is that you are being robbed through gradual printing of money. This meme has never stood up to the most basic examination. Moderate inflation is fine, necessary, and infinitely better than deflation. We are vastly better off than we were when a dollar could buy a bag or groceries, but acknowledging that would undermine the narrative. It does not matter, however. Never let the facts get in the way of a good story. To sustain its value, bitcoin needs a very assertive social consensus. And that has to continue for an exceedingly long time. Gold\u2019s use as a shared global store of value dates to 650 BCE in ancient T\u00fcrkiye, so they have a significant head start. And while there are other precious metals, none of them have ever approached gold in terms of total market capitalization. The market cap of gold is 10 times larger than the market cap for silver. The social ecosystem that underpins Ethereum is different. First and foremost, Ethereum is the world computer. Ethereum is a positive-sum ecosystem where people are encouraged to build and extend. The discussion and tone of r/Ethereum is, again, a good proxy for the whole ecosystem: it is focused on engineering, development, and new applications. Ethereum, like bitcoin, has an equally passionate Layer Zero ecosystem and is as dominant compared to other \u201csmart contract\u201d blockchains as bitcoin is to other pure crypto-assets. Ethereum\u2019s dominance is visible in the market cap of the asset but also in its share of tokenized assets. Ethereum is the dominant ecosystem for most \u201creal-world\u201d assets and the majority of stablecoins as well. With over 100 Layer 2 networks in operation, Ethereum has 20 times more \u201cnetwork extensions\u201d than any other ecosystem, including bitcoin and Solana. Both the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems have ardent believers that see things differently from the dominant narrative. There is a small, but resilient application layer being built upon bitcoin. Bitcoin will soon have its own layer two networks, including some that are EVM- compatible. Similarly, there is a passionate group of Ethereum believers who think Ethereum should be both the network computer and a scarcity-based asset. EIP-1559 (Ethereum Improvement Proposal), which was adopted in August 2021, reduced the rate at which new ETH was issued and shifted the gas fee model so some ETH is burned with each transaction. The result is that the amount of ETH in circulation is increasing at a slower pace than bitcoin and, in some cases, even decreasing. Neither of these is necessarily a bad idea and, at least in theory, either ecosystem could be a host to both types of activity. In practice, the cultural requirements of each ecosystem are so different that they cannot really excel at more than one function at a time. In the real world, currencies like the U.S. dollar are most effective as a means of exchange, but not necessarily as a store of value. You can use dollars to buy things, but a deflationary system that increased the value of the dollar, over time, would be catastrophic for the economy as it forced up real interest rates. As Ben Bernanke discovered, trying to stimulate an economy when inflation is low is very difficult. The same problem makes bitcoin unsuitable as a currency even while it may excel as a store of value. With Ethereum, we\u2019ll see how well the current blockchain boom plays out over the next few years. If the ecosystem retains its dominant share of new asset tokenization and smart contracts, I think we can declare it a winner on the primary mission. Bitcoin has a longer game to play, but if we see increasing correlation with gold, that may be an indicator that real-world investors are buying into the argument for digital scarcity. Either way, it could be several more years of real world experience before I can prove (or disprove) my theory. This also means that memetic warfare on Twitter between ecosystems isn\u2019t going away anytime soon.

    "content": "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s crypto arm, SG Forge, is reportedly preparing to launch a dollar-backed stablecoin on Ethereum, making it the first global banking group to issue a public stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar. SG Forge\u2019s dollar stablecoin would be publicly accessible on Ethereum, with additional support for Solana to follow. The launch is expected in the coming weeks, according to a report by French publication The Big Whale. The move would expand SG Forge\u2019s footprint in the digital asset space following the 2023 debut of its euro stablecoin, EURCV . The token would initially serve institutional investors, leveraging SG Forge\u2019s e-money license to operate legally across the European Union, according to the report. The shift would come amid accelerating stablecoin adoption. World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance project backed by the family of U.S. President Donald Trump, has launched its own dollar-denominated stablecoin, USD1, which has been used to settle MGX\u2019s $2 billion investment in Binance. Banks, according to BitGo\u2019s managing director of stablecoin Ben Reynolds, are exploring stablecoins in a bid to avoid being outpaced by cryptocurrency-native competitors. These financial institutions are needed to unlock the full potential of these tokens , PayPal\u2019s crypto head Jose Fernandez da Ponte said at Consensus 2025 in Toronto. SG Forge\u2019s euro-denominated stablecoin, EURCV, currently has a market capitalization of around $46.5 million, far behind competitors including Circle\u2019s EURC token, whose market cap exceeds $237 million. Euro-denominated tokens represent a fraction of the $243 billion stablecoin market. U.S. dollar stablecoins dominate the ecosystem, with Circle\u2019s USDC commanding a $60.6 billion market cap, behind the market leader USDT, Tether\u2019s flagship stablecoin with a $151.6 billion market cap.

The second-largest cryptocurrency is currently navigating a critical technical zone between $2,500-$2,530, which analysts identify as immediate resistance that must be overcome for continued upward movement. Institutional interest remains strong, with spot Ethereum ETFs recording consecutive days of positive inflows, signaling growing confidence from larger investors despite the recent volatility. Technical Analysis Highlights 24-hour ETH price action revealed a substantial 3.5% range ($99.85). Sharp sell-off during midnight hour saw price plummet to $2,477.40, establishing a key support zone. Extraordinary volume (291,395 units, nearly 3x average) confirmed the significance of the support level. Buyers stepped in at the $2,467-$2,480 support band, confirmed by high-volume accumulation during the 08:00-09:00 period. Recent price action shows bullish momentum with ETH reclaiming the $2,515 level. Potential higher low pattern suggests the correction may have found its bottom. $2,520-$2,530 area remains the immediate resistance to overcome for continued upward movement. Significant bullish surge at 13:35 saw price jump from $2,515.85 to $2,521.79, accompanied by exceptional volume (5,839 units).

The price action shows a convincing rebound from the $2,470-$2,495 demand zone, though technical indicators suggest caution as ETH approaches the significant $2,800 resistance level where on-chain data reveals a cluster of investor cost basis that could increase selling pressure. Global economic tensions and ongoing trade disputes continue to cast shadows over crypto markets, yet Ethereum's resilience stands out amid the uncertainty. Technical Analysis Highlights ETH formed a clear uptrend with higher lows and higher highs over the 24-hour period, demonstrating strong bullish momentum. Above-average volume during the 22:00 and 00:00 hours supported ETH's breakthrough of previous resistance levels. A notable volume spike of 178,236 units during the 07:00 hour coincided with ETH reaching its 24-hour high of $2,597. The subsequent pullback to $2,554 suggests profit-taking after the substantial rally, potentially setting up a consolidation phase. In the final hour, ETH experienced significant volatility with a sharp 0.73% correction from $2,571.25 to $2,552.40. Dramatic price action between 13:53-13:55 saw ETH plummet to $2,545.12, accompanied by volume spikes exceeding 10x the average minute volume.

    "content": "Ethereum ETH has staged an impressive recovery in the past 24 hours, climbing 3.8% amid significant market volatility. The second-largest cryptocurrency found solid support at $2,530, where exceptional trading volume (242,521 ETH) created a clear bottoming pattern. This was followed by a decisive breakout during the early trading hours, supported by massive volume surges exceeding 550,000 ETH that pushed prices above key resistance levels. The recent price action confirms a short-term trend reversal, with ETH now trading above $2,575 after establishing new local highs. Institutional interest remains robust, with spot Ethereum ETFs recording $248 million in total net inflows over the past week, suggesting growing confidence from larger investors despite relatively subdued retail participation. Market analysts point to the $2,800 level as a critical resistance zone where many investors who previously bought at that level may look to exit at break-even. However, with ETH breaking out of its recent consolidation pattern and the broader crypto market showing signs of strength, bulls are now targeting the $2,650-$2,745 range as the next significant hurdle. Technical Analysis A clear bottoming pattern formed during the 01:00 hour with exceptionally high volume (242,521 ETH), establishing strong volume support. A decisive breakout occurred during the 06:00-07:00 hours with massive volume surges (553,348 ETH and 221,502 ETH respectively). The price action showed three distinct phases: initial consolidation (07:04-07:29), powerful breakout (07:30-07:32) with high volume spikes exceeding 7,000 ETH per minute, and sustained uptrend. The $2,600 level is now established as a new support zone with momentum indicators suggesting potential for further upside toward $2,650. High-volume support at $2,530 now serves as a critical floor for any retracements.

    "content": "The crypto industry is on the precipice of mainstream adoption. But, like many exciting innovations from previous eras, this technology brings new risks. And these new risks must be mitigated before crypto can achieve its full potential. During the Industrial Revolution, steam power drove immense progress but carried deadly risks. Steam boilers exploded with alarming regularity \u2014 at one point nearly once every four days, wreaking havoc on lives and property. Early insurers stepped in to make this technology safer to scale. By providing financial guarantees against catastrophe, insurance turned what many saw as \u201cacts of God\u201d into manageable risks. Investors\u2019 increased confidence allowed them to commit capital into steam-powered ventures, helping that breakthrough technology of the time further evolve to transform society. Today, Ethereum validators serve as new \u201csteam engines\u201d \u2014 critical infrastructure that can drive evolution, but are subject to inherent risks. In proof-of-stake, validators lock up and pledge their $ETH tokens to run and secure the network, but any misstep can trigger a slashing incident (forfeiting some staked funds). These events are rare, but their mere possibility has been a major concern for institutional participants. Until recently, insurance for stakers only covered slashing incidents \u2014 a safety net like boiler explosion coverage, tackling the worst-case scenario to encourage wider participation. Now, insurance is helping the crypto industry evolve more fully; this month, crypto insurer IMA Financial and Chainproof launched a policy that not only covers slashing losses but also guarantees a minimum annual yield for Ethereum stakers. The return is pegged to CESR(R) , the Composite Ether Staking Rate, the average staking yield network-wide. By insuring yields, this coverage brings a new level of security to their staking returns. A new frontier for crypto finance Insuring validator yields opens the door to financial products once thought too risky. With a reliable floor on returns, we could soon see total-return staked ether ETFs and other structured products built on staking income. As staking moves into ETFs and institutional portfolios, insured yields will be imperative. Just as boiler insurance unlocked investment opportunities in railroads and factories, this new crypto insurance can unlock institutional capital for blockchain networks. By making cutting-edge ventures safer for investors, insurance supports the responsible deployment of capital at the edge of innovation \u2014 powering the next wave of growth with clarity and conviction.",

    "headline": "Ethereum Upgrades Have Failed to Boost Network Activity in Meaningful Way: JPMorgan",
    "content": "The Ethereum blockchain has yet to see a significant increase in activity despite successive upgrades, investment bank JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report. \"Neither the number of daily transactions nor the number of active addresses saw a material increase post recent upgrades,\" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in the Wednesday report. Still, total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum increased between the Dencun upgrade in March 2024 and Pectra earlier this month, the bank noted, possibly due to increased lending and borrowing on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), but the increase looks lower in dollar terms than in the blockchain's ether ETH token. Ethereum activated the Pectra upgrade on May 7. The update aims to streamline staking, enhance wallet functionality and improve overall efficiency. Pectra makes the ETH token and Ethereum itself more appealing to institutions, the bank said. It distinguishes the network from competitors, but the upgrades haven't boosted activity in a meaningful way. The bank noted that following the Dencun upgrade, both average and total fees fell, in part because of a shift toward layer 2 chains. Ether's circulating supply also increased after Dencun, which raised concerns about the crypto \"becoming an inflationary asset amid subdued transaction activity,\" JPMorgan said. Futures positioning suggests that institutions played a large role in the recent rally in ether, the report added. Ether has risen more than 45% in the past month, CoinDesk data show.

    "content": "Malicious Ethereum contracts designed to drain wallets with weak security aren't profiting from the operation, crypto market maker Wintermute said Friday, identifying these contracts as \"CrimeEnjoyors.\" The whole issue is tied to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-7702 , part of the Pectra upgrade that went live early last month. It allows regular Ethereum addresses, secured by private keys, to temporarily operate as smart contracts, facilitating batched transactions, password authentication and spending limits. The regular Ethereum addresses delegate control of their wallets to smart contracts, granting them permission to manage or move their funds. While it has simplified the user experience, it has also created a risk of malicious contracts draining funds. As of Friday, more than 80% of delegations made through EIP-7702 involved reused, copy-and-paste contracts designed to automatically scan and identify weak wallets for potential theft. \"Our Research team found that over 97% of all EIP-7702 delegations were authorized to multiple contracts using the same exact code . These are sweepers , used to automatically drain incoming ETH from compromised addresses,\" Wintermute said on X . \"The CrimeEnjoyor contract is short, simple, and widely reused. This copy-pasted bytecode now represents the majority of all EIP-7702 delegations. It\u2019s funny, dark, and fascinating all at once,\" the market maker added. Notable cases include a wallet that lost nearly $150,000 through malicious batched transactions in a fishing attack, as anti-scam tracker Scam Sniffer noted . Still, the large-scale money drain has not been profitable for the attackers. The CrimeEnjoyors spent approximately 2.88 ETH to authorize around 79,000 addresses. One particular address \u20130x89383882fc2d0cd4d7952a3267a3b6dae967e704 \u2013 handled more than half of these authorizations, with 52,000 permissions granted to it. Per Wintermute's researcher , the stolen ether can be traced by analyzing the code of these contracts. For the above example, the ETH is destined to flow the address \u20130x6f6Bd3907428ae93BC58Aca9Ec25AE3a80110428. However, as of Friday, it had no inbound ETH transfers.

Its Bectra hard fork \u2013\u2013 named for Ethereum's recent 'Pectra' upgrade \u2014 goes live today, giving more than 100 apps on the chain access to tools that could enhance how users and developers interact with the platform. Because Berachain\u2019s consensus model is different from Ethereum\u2019s, it doesn\u2019t include Pectra\u2019s consensus changes. But since it\u2019s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible, developers don\u2019t need to rewrite existing contracts \u2014 a relief for the 200-plus apps already live on Berachain. For users, the Bectra upgrade means every wallet can now work like a smart account. They will be able to batch transactions in one click, set spending limits, pay gas with HONEY (Berachain\u2019s stablecoin), or even set up recurring payments. Previously, these features needed custom contracts or third-party implementations (which carry security concerns). \u2014 Shaurya Malwa Read more . ETHEREUM FOUNDATION LAYOFFS AMID RESTRUCTURING: The Ethereum Foundation has laid off some members of its research and development team as part of a broader restructuring effort aimed at refocusing on critical protocol design challenges, the organization said in a blog post . The shake-up comes as the Switzerland-based nonprofit grapples with ongoing criticism over its management and strategic direction . Some in the Ethereum community have warned for over a year that failure to address key technical hurdles could threaten Ethereum's status as an industry leader , and the organization has already undergone leadership changes in part to address these concerns. The foundation is rebranding its Protocol Research and Development division under the simplified name \u201cProtocol,\u201d and is repositioning the group around three main priorities: scaling Ethereum\u2019s base layer, expanding blobspace (a key part of its data availability strategy), and improving user experience.

TECH EXPERTS UNIMPRESSED AT MUSK\u2019S BTC X-FEATURE : Billionaire X owner Elon Musk shared over the weekend the launch of a brand-new messaging app called XChat. Neither the bitcoin market nor the tech community is impressed. A key feature of the new offering is that it's written with the Rust programming language and uses what Musk touted as \"Bitcoin-style\" encryption. While it sounds exciting, the crypto community is not particularly psyched, raising doubts about the platform's Bitcoin-inspired technical promises.. \"Bitcoin primarily uses signatures, not encryption.

CRYPTO EXCHANGE BITOPRO LIKELY HACKED FOR $11M, ZachXBT SAYS: Taiwanese cryptocurrency exchange BitoPro is suspected to have lost over $11.5 million worth of tokens in a May 8 exploit, widely-followed blockchain sleuth ZachXBT said in his Telegram group. The exploit involved unauthorized access to BitoPro's hot wallets across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Tron, Solana, and Polygon. The stolen assets were then sold on decentralized exchanges, with proceeds laundered through privacy protocols such as Tornado Cash and Thorchain, and eventually moved to Wasabi Wallet, a Bitcoin mixing service. BitoPro has not issued any public statements acknowledging the breach since the supposed explicit. Users were informed of a temporary service suspension due to \"system maintenance\u201d last month, and there was little social chatter in popular crypto X circles around the incident at the time. \u2014 Shaurya Malwa Read more .

    "headline": "Ethereum Foundation Unveils New Treasury Policy With 15% Opex Cap",
    "content": "The Ethereum Foundation published an updated treasury policy on Wednesday, outlining a series of new plans around token sales, fiat purchases and transparency practices designed to ensure the organization's \"long-term agency, sustainability, and legitimacy.\" The EF, a Swiss non-profit, plays a central role in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. In addition to employing researchers, builders and community liaisons, the foundation was granted a large trove of ether (ETH) tokens at Ethereum's genesis which it uses to fund its operations and support other projects in the ecosystem. In a blog post on Wednesday, the foundation stated it plans to annually designate 15% of its treasury to operational expenses (\"opex\"), with a 2.5-year buffer kept at all times in its reserves. \"We intend to reduce annual opex roughly linearly over the next five years, ending at a long-term 5% baseline,\" the foundation wrote. \"This policy reflects our conviction that 2025-26 are likely to be pivotal for Ethereum, warranting enhanced focus on critical deliverables.\" In addition to periodically selling some of its ETH tokens onto the market, the foundation said it will occasionally diversify its holdings into fiat to ensure it can continue funding key ecosystem projects regardless of crypto market conditions. The foundation emphasized that decisions about managing its treasury \u2014 including occasional ETH sales \u2014 are made with operational planning and risk mitigation in mind. The foundation stated that its investments are not driven by speculative goals, but to ensure EF can continue to support the ecosystem well into the future. \u201cWe will frequently reallocate funds between protocols for reasons such as changing market conditions, diversification, or new yield opportunities,\u201d the foundation wrote. \u201cWithdrawals should be understood in this context and not as anti-endorsements.\u201d Furthermore, the foundation promised to publish quarterly financial reports to its board, as well as an annual report, which in the past has been made public. On Oct. 31, 2024 , the EF shared it had $970.2 million in treasury , down 39% from the previous time the organization reported its financial standings. Token-rich crypto foundations like the Ethereum Foundation have, for years, been at the center of many of the industry's biggest controversies. Foundations hold immense power within the ecosystems they serve, but they are frequently criticized for having opaque operations, generous compensation packages and vague responsibilities. Wednesday's post comes amid a broader push by the Ethereum community for foundation transparency and reform. In 2024, a pair of Ethereum Foundation researchers came under fire for quietly accepting token allocations from Ethereum-based projects, pushing the entire organization into a reckoning around conflicts of interest. Ethereum has also faced heightened competition from other blockchains over the past year, and some within the community have pushed for the Ethereum Foundation to act with more urgency in pushing along the ecosystem's tech development. Earlier this week, the foundation shared that it had laid off some members as part of a restructuring of its research arm. Read more: Ethereum Foundation Lays Off Some Staff Amid R&D Restructuring",

    "content": "The Ethereum blockchain's unique selling point is its role as a decentralized computer, Wall Street broker Bernstein said in a research report Monday. Inflows into ether ETH exchange-traded funds are increasing as institutions become aware of the network's value proposition, the broker said. The blockchain \"deserves love\" as it is useful technology, according to the report, acknowledging that ether's larger peer bitcoin benefits from its perception as a store of value, or digital gold. \"Interesting blockchain use cases such as stablecoins and tokenization are native to Ethereum, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote, adding that the network enjoys \"maximum market share\" in these areas. Companies that use stablecoin technology are paying transaction fees to the Ethereum blockchain, the report noted. As institutions become more aware of the value inherent in the network, ether ETF inflows have begun to pick up, the report noted. Ether ETF inflows reached $815 million over the last 20 days, with year-to-date net inflows turning positive at $658 million, Bernstein said. \"The narrative around value accrual of public blockchain networks is at a critical inflection point, \" the broker said, and this is \"starting to reflect in investor interest in ETH ETF inflows.\" Read more: ETH Surges as Spot ETF Inflows Hit 15-Day Streak, Traders Watch $2,540 Level",

    "content": "Long-time Ethereum advocate William Mougayar is to be the curator and editor of the Ethereum Market Research Center (EMRC) , a community-led initiative aimed at raising the profile of the blockchain's ecosystem among institutional and professional audiences. EMRC will feature contributions from prominent builders, researchers and analysts across the Ethereum landscape. It will include original research authored by EMRC contributors, curated material by external sources, thought-leadership pieces and a real-time news feed. Ethereum comprises a large and innovative ecosystem that plays host to the major stablecoin market share, the proliferation of real-world assets (RWAs) and most of the total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi). But many argue this has not been reflected in the price of the ether ETH token. That's partly because rival blockchains have been more organized and systematic about getting their message across, Mougayar said. \u201cEthereum is No. 1 when it comes to market share, but we realize it has not been communicating its messages as well as it should,\u201d Mougayar said in an interview. \u201cMeanwhile, Solana has been very aggressive from a marketing perspective.\u201d The new research hub aims to take on some of the educational burden not suited to the developer-focused Ethereum Foundation, and simply to \u201cre-energize the Ethereum message,\u201d Mougayar said. The move is part of a wider drive to push Ethereum into its next institutional phase, while will involve multiple firms and individual leaders, he added. The idea that many competing layer-2 blockchains running on top of Ethereum and offering cheaper and faster transactions has somehow cannibalized the mother chain is more of a misplaced perception than an actual issue, Mougayar said. \u201cEthereum is really the L2s and the L1 working together,\u201d Mougayar said. \u201cBy the end of the year, there will probably be 200 L2s. So it\u2019s about a whole ecosystem and not about a contest of features. Ethereum is very decentralized and it\u2019s going to continue to grow laterally, just like the internet.\u201d Wholehearted decentralization, something lacking in other blockchain ecosystems, Mougayar points out, does make things like messaging tricky for Ethereum. \u201cThe problem with a decentralized system is that everything is all over the place and in some ways that can be a weakness,\u201d Mougayar said. \u201cSo the way to remedy this weakness is to recentralize some of this. So at some point in time, you have to recentralize the decentralized mass so you can see it, so it can be easier for people to see it all in one place.\u201d",

    "content": "The Cosmos ecosystem token has established key support levels around $4.50 as traders navigate the complex interplay between traditional finance concerns and digital asset opportunities. Ethereum whales have doubled their transaction activity in 24 hours, with large transaction volumes surging 164.14% to $7.84 billion, potentially signaling the start of an altcoin season, of which ATOM would benefit. ATOM-USD experienced a volatile trading session with a 3.5% range, showing strong volume support at the $4.502 level where buyers stepped in with 1.63M volume. Technical Analysis Breakdown ATOM-USD exhibited a notable trading range of 0.157 (3.5%) over the 24-hour period, with price action characterized by an initial uptrend reaching a peak of 4.619 before experiencing a sharp correction to 4.498. Strong volume support emerged at the 4.502 level during the 12:00 hour, where buyers stepped in with 1.63M volume (significantly above the 24-hour SMA), propelling prices back above 4.560. The formation of a higher low at 4.522 following the correction suggests potential bullish momentum building, though resistance around 4.600 remains a key level to monitor for potential breakout opportunities. In the last hour, ATOM-USD demonstrated notable volatility with a clear uptrend followed by a sharp correction. Price action began at 4.556 and climbed steadily to reach a peak of 4.589 at 13:27, representing a 0.7% gain within 22 minutes. This rally was supported by increasing volume, particularly at 13:17 where volume spiked to 77,531 units. A significant reversal occurred at 13:31, with prices dropping 2.1% to 4.556 by 13:57, forming a key support level that buyers defended. The final minutes showed modest recovery with prices consolidating around 4.564, suggesting potential stabilization after the volatile session.",

    "content": "SharpLink Gaming (SBET), a Nasdaq-listed company that is pursuing an ether ETH treasury strategy, tumbled 70% on Thursday in after-hours trading following a fresh filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company submitted an S-3ASR registration statement , enabling the resale of up to 58,699,760 shares related to its private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing. The Thursday filing allows more than 100 shareholders in the PIPE round to sell their shares, effectively flooding the market and triggering a post-close sell-off, Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, a publicly-traded firm that's pursuing crypto reserve strategy, explained in an X post and an interview with CoinDesk. The company raised $450 million earlier this month through a PIPE round from a wide range of investors, including ConsenSys, Galaxy, and Pantera Capital, to acquire ETH for its treasury. Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin also joined the firm as board chairman. However, there may be a larger strategy behind the latest move. Allen said in an X post that he thinks the company may have quietly raised up to $1 billion to buy more ETH using an at-the-market (ATM) offering that was previously announced in a May 30 SEC filing . \"If they played cards right, they would expect a surprise PR tomorrow with $1B of ETH purchases, which could light the match to reignite the stock,\" he said.

Unlike Arizona and New Hampshire, which passed similar legislation, Texas did not just authorize the reserve but is actively funding it. The state will be appropriating $10 million in order to purchase bitcoin for the reserve. \u2014 Tom Carreras Read more .

    "headline": "Why Are There No Big DApps on Ethereum?",
    "content": "On July 30, 2025, we will be celebrating a decade since Ethereum launched on mainnet. Inarguably, one of the biggest milestones in this industry\u2019s short life. When it launched as the world\u2019s first smart contract platform, this was obviously something entirely new and a completely new way of thinking about software. Instead of renting access to someone else's platform that could change the rules or lock you out at any moment, one could \u2013 in theory \u2013 now participate in systems that belonged to everyone and no one, where the rules were written in code and couldn't be arbitrarily changed by a CEO's whim. Users would own their date, and software would be maintained and managed by a network rather than a boardroom. The consequences seemed pretty utopian. However, nearly ten years on from Ethereum\u2019s launch and the dreams of a Web3 version of Amazon, eBay, Facebook or TikTok haven\u2019t arrived, and are nowhere on the horizon. Gavin Wood, Ethereum co-founder, and his vision of \u201cWeb3\u201d envisaged exactly that. Joe Lubin, the renowned founder of Consensys, said that \u201cEthereum will have that same pervasive influence on our communications and our entire information infrastructure.\" The libertarian journalist Jim Epstein predicted a year after Ethereum\u2019s launch that \u201cthe same types of services offered by companies like Facebook, Google, eBay, and Amazon will be provided instead by computers distributed around the globe.\u201d Vitalik Buterin himself envisaged Ethereum \u201claw, cloud storage, prediction markets, trading decentralized hosting, [hosting] your own currency,\u201d in his 2014 Bitcoin Miami speech , where he announced Ethereum to the world. \u201cPerhaps even Skynet,\u201d the fictional artificial neural network from the Terminator films. He has described the platform he created as both a threat and an opportunity to platforms like Facebook and Twitter back in 2021. The Scale Problem The barrier to achieving this vision is scale. The most successful consumer applications today serve hundreds of millions of users. Instagram processes more than 1 billion photo uploads daily. eBay handles roughly 17 billion dollars in transactions each quarter. Facebook's messaging platforms process trillions of messages annually. Ethereum processes about 14 transactions per second, and Solana can handle over 1000. Instagram handles over 1 billion photo uploads daily. eBay processes 17 billion dollars in transactions quarterly. The math doesn't work. Let's entertain the decentralized eBay example for a moment. A truly decentralized eBay would demand far more than simple payments. Every listing creation or update would require onchain transactions for item metadata, pricing, and condition details. Auctions would need automatic bidding resolution with time-locked smart contracts. Escrow systems would have to hold funds until delivery confirmation, with DAO arbitration for disputes. User reputation systems would require immutable rating storage tied to wallet addresses. Inventory management would need real-time stock tracking, possibly through tokenized goods. Shipping confirmations would demand oracle integration for delivery proofs. Marketplace fees and tax royalties would need smart contract enforcement. Optional identity verification systems would require decentralized credential management. Each interaction would multiply the transaction load exponentially beyond what current infrastructure could support. It goes without saying that this would require a blockchain of unprecedented speed and throughput. Frankly, a decade after Ethereum, the infrastructure just hasn\u2019t been there to support it. The Economics Don't Work The business model hasn't always made sense either. Modern applications need massive scale to generate revenue that covers development costs. Furthermore, layer 2 solutions fragment users across platforms, where (for example) Arbitrum users can't directly interact with Polygon applications. This defeats the purpose of building unified global computing. This isn't theoretical. OpenSea struggled with profitability despite dominating NFT trading with high-value transactions & fee-tolerant users. If you can't profit from selling digital art to crypto enthusiasts paying hundreds in fees, how do you build a marketplace for used goods? The economics are even worse for lower-value transactions that define mainstream commerce. A decentralized social network charging $5 per post would be dead on arrival. Gaming applications that require a few dollars in transaction fees for every item trade won't attract players who expect the same for free elsewhere. So far, the only viable on-chain businesses have been those that can extract massive value from relatively few users \u2013 essentially high-stakes financial applications and speculative trading. The Calvary Is Coming The industry accepted a false tradeoff: security and decentralization, or functionality and scale, but not both. But transaction throughput has steadily increased (and will continue to ) across networks as the technology matures. We can now achieve massive scale even with proof of work chains, maintaining the security and decentralization that made blockchain revolutionary in the first place (rather than the premature embrace of proof of stake that compromised these principles). Zero-knowledge proofs allow users to prove transaction validity locally, submitting only small cryptographic proofs that are aggregated recursively and in parallel by a network of provers. Networks can process millions of transactions without every node verifying each one individually. When users prove their own transactions, the marginal cost of adding an additional transaction approaches zero, and blockchains can finally support the economics that mainstream applications require. But ten years on, it's clear that the vision once laid out by the futurists of Web3 has moved at a disappointing pace. Let's hope the next decade moves a little faster \u2013 and, fingers crossed \u2013 our blockchains too.",

    "content": "Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap-up of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I'm Margaux Nijkerk, CoinDesk\u2019s Tech & Protocols reporter. In this issue: Vitalik Buterin: Ethereum at Risk If Decentralization Is Just a Catchphrase Bitcoin Layer-2 Botanix Mainnet Debuts, Cuts Block Times to 5 Seconds XRPL EVM Sidechain Goes Live, Unlocking Ethereum Dapps in XRP Ecosystem Securitize, RedStone Pilot \u2018Trusted Single Source Oracle\u2019 to Secure Tokenized Fund NAVs Unknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Network News BUTERIN: CRYPTO MUST MATURE: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wants the crypto industry to grow up fast \u2014 stressing that the industry is at an \u201cinflection point.\u201d Speaking in front of a packed room at the Ethereum Community Conference, in Cannes, France, Buterin used his keynote to deliver a clear-eyed reality check: decentralization, he argued, must evolve from a catchphrase to a concrete set of user guarantees \u2014 or risk becoming another hollow promise. As the industry has gone mainstream with endorsements from major corporations and political figures, builders need to return to the ecosystem\u2019s key ideals surrounding decentralization and building for users' needs, Buterin said. In his typical jeans and relaxed dark t-shirt uniform, Buterin laid out practical \u201ctests\u201d that he said every crypto project should pass. These include 1) the walk-away test. If the company behind an application disappears, do users keep their assets? And 2) the insider attack test: How much damage can rogue insiders or compromised front-ends cause? And 3) whether it has a trusted computing base: How many lines of code must be trusted to protect users\u2019 funds or data? He warned that too many layer-2 networks, DeFi projects and \u201cdecentralized\u201d front-ends rely on hidden backdoors, instant upgrade buttons or insecure interfaces that can be tampered with and hacked. \u2014 Margaux Nijkerk Read more . BITCOIN LAYER-2 BOTANIX GOES LIVE: The mainnet of Botanix, a network designed to bring Ethereum-equivalent utility to the Bitcoin ecosystem, has gone live, slashing the time it takes to add new blocks to five seconds from 10 minutes. The network is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the software that powers the Ethereum blockchain, allowing Ethereum-based applications and smart contracts to be copied and pasted onto Bitcoin, developer Botanix Labs said in an email. Botanix is one of several projects attempting to scale the Bitcoin blockchain and make it a more conducive venue for decentralized finance (DeFi) by enhancing its utility and programmability. Others include Rootstock, Stacks and BOB (\"Build on Bitcoin\"), which have all adopted the BitVM computing paradigm that can make complex computations verifiable on Bitcoin, paving the way for smart-contract provision, similar to Ethereum's. The expansion of Bitcoin's utility would allow developers to take advantage of the value held in BTC, which dwarfs that of all other digital assets . \u2014 Jamie Crawley Read more . XRP LEDGER EVM-SIDECHAIN MAINNET LAUNCHES : Ripple officially introduced the XRP Ledger's Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain to the mainnet in an bid to improve the ecosystem's interoperability and allow developers to deploy their Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dapps) with the XRPL. The development adds EVM-compatible smart contracts while maintaining a connection to the XRPL , giving developers access to the ecosystem at a low cost, Ripple said in a blog post. It is designed to eliminate the trade-off between EVM compatibility and XRPL\u2019s own advantages, opening the door for dapps to lean into XRP\u2019s payments infrastructure. The sidechain operates as a separate blockchain that is parallel and connected to the XRP Ledger over the Axelar bridge, an interoperability protocol. XRPL\u2019s native token, XRP, will serve as the native gas token for the sidechain. \u2014 Margaux Nijkerk Read more . SECURITIZE, REDSTONE RELEASE NEW ORACLE MODEL WHITEPAPER: Securitize, one of the largest tokenized asset issuers, and oracle provider RedStone have released a whitepaper they say introduces a new model for securely verifying Net Asset Value (NAV) data on-chain, tailored specifically for tokenized private funds. The model, dubbed the Trusted Single Source Oracle (TSSO), is designed to address a key gap in decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure: how to reliably prove that each NAV update really comes from the trusted source \u2014 and hasn\u2019t been tampered with once it\u2019s on-chain. In traditional crypto markets, oracles pull data from multiple price feeds to guard against manipulation or errors. But for private funds, the NAV is calculated by a single fund administrator. That creates a unique problem: there\u2019s no way to double-check the number through market aggregation. For DeFi protocols that rely on accurate collateral values, this single point of trust has been a sticking point. The TSSO framework solves this by creating a cryptographically linked chain of NAV updates, according to the whitepaper. Each update includes a secure digital signature, a timestamp, a reference to the previous record, and a hash that locks the sequence together. The system uses two keys: a cold-stored \u201croot key\u201d for major updates and a \u201cchain key\u201d for small, routine changes that stay within tight thresholds. This design aims to balance high security with the practical need to refresh NAV data without constant manual work. \u2014 Margaux Nijkerk Read more .

    "content": "Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase's Layer 2 scaling solution, Base, has gone from being the leader in 2024 in terms of capital inflows through cross-chain bridges to the top loser this year. Data from the Artemis Terminal shows Base has seen a net outflow of $4.3 billion this year, a stark contrast to the net inflow of $3.8 billion in 2024, which was the highest among the top 20 blockchains. Meanwhile, Ethereum, the world's largest smart contract blockchain, has registered a net inflow of $8.5 billion this year, compared to a net outflow of $7.4 billion in the previous year. The data show the momentum behind the Base chain has decelerated, with Ethereum reclaiming its top spot. Crypto bridges are protocols that facilitate communication and interaction between different blockchains, enhancing interoperability. Bridging, therefore, refers to the act of moving tokens between different networks. The cumulative supply of stablecoins on Base has also flattened above $4 billion since mid-May alongside slower trading volumes, as the chart below shows. BASE bleeding ETH According to the data source L2BEAT , the total number of ether (ETH) deposited on BASE has crashed from 1.82 million ETH to just over 835,000 ETH in four weeks. The trend is consistent with other Layer 2 solutions, which have seen notable ETH outflows in recent weeks, according to Michael\u00a0Nadeau of The DeFi Report on X. According to Coinbase's Protocol Specialist Viktor Bunin, the outflows are likely due to Binance withdrawing capital to the Layer 1. \"The vast majority is just Binance withdrawing to L1. They kept an ungodly amount on the L2s. Unclear if they were getting incentives to keep it there or just didn't balance across their supported chains,\" Bunin said on X .",

    "content": "At the time of writing, Ether (ETH) is trading at around $2,505, up 0.56% in the past 24-hours, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. As for the broader crypto market as gauged by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), it is up 0.34% during the same period. SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (SBET) is a pioneering online performance marketing company specializing in the sports betting and iGaming industries. Headquartered in Minneapolis, SharpLink leverages its AI-powered C4 platform to deliver personalized, data-driven marketing content that enhances customer acquisition and retention for sportsbook and casino operators. The company has expanded through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, establishing itself as a leader in the evolving sports betting ecosystem. On July 4, 2025, SharpLink announced on X that it has become the first publicly listed company to adopt ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset. The company outlined a comprehensive treasury strategy focused on accumulating ETH, staking it, and growing ETH-per-share to create long-term shareholder value. SharpLink emphasized that its goal is not just to hold ETH but to actively deploy it through native staking, restaking, and Ethereum-based yield strategies. The company highlighted ETH's advantages as a corporate reserve asset: it is productive via staking rewards, composable across decentralized finance protocols, scarce, secure, and aligned with the infrastructure of the future internet. This approach represents a bold redefinition of traditional treasury management, integrating decentralized finance principles into corporate finance. This strategic pivot began with a $425 million private placement announced on May 27, led by Consensys and other prominent crypto investors, to fund the acquisition of ETH as SharpLink\u2019s primary treasury asset. Joseph Lubin, Ethereum co-founder and founder of Consensys, joined SharpLink\u2019s Board of Directors as Chairman upon closing this placement, reinforcing the company\u2019s commitment to blockchain innovation. Since officially launching its ETH treasury strategy on June 2, SharpLink has aggressively expanded its Ethereum holdings. Between May 30 and June 12, 2025, the company acquired approximately 176,271 ETH for about $463 million at an average price of $2,626 per ETH. Following this, from June 16 to June 20, SharpLink purchased an additional 12,207 ETH for roughly $30.7 million, funded in part by $27.7 million raised through At-The-Market (ATM) equity sales. By June 24, SharpLink\u2019s ETH holdings reached 188,478 ETH, with 100% of these reserves deployed in staking solutions generating staking rewards. And by July 1, the treasury expanded further to 198,478 ETH, yielding over 220 ETH in staking rewards since the strategy\u2019s inception. Joseph Lubin has stated that embedding Ethereum at the core of SharpLink\u2019s capital strategy embodies technological progress and institutional trust, positioning the company to lead the evolution of digital commerce. Meanwhile, CEO Rob Phythian has noted that SharpLink\u2019s upcoming Nasdaq closing bell ceremony on July 7, 2025, will symbolize this new chapter, showcasing how digital assets can coexist with public market discipline and corporate governance. SharpLink\u2019s Ethereum treasury strategy uniquely positions the company at the crossroads of sports betting, blockchain technology, and decentralized finance, offering investors regulated and transparent exposure to Ethereum\u2019s growth potential while advancing SharpLink\u2019s mission to innovate the multi-billion-dollar iGaming industry. Technical Analysis Highlights ETH gained 2.2% from July 4 15:00 to July 5 14:00, climbing from $2,475.48 to $2,530.02. A sharp sell-off between 13:06 and 14:05 pushed ETH down to $2,514.85 before buyers stepped in. Strong support formed between $2,480 and $2,500 during the July 5 16:00 hour, with 382,821 ETH traded. A bullish breakout on July 4 at 22:00 lifted ETH above $2,520, with resistance confirmed near $2,530. ETH consolidated around $2,515 with signs of reduced volatility and an ascending recovery trendline after 13:40. Momentum remains neutral short-term but structurally bullish given broader uptrend since late June.

    "headline": "Vitalik Buterin's New Proposal Seeks 16.7M Gas Cap on Ethereum to Rein In Transaction Bloat",
    "content": "A new Ethereum proposal , co-authored by Vitalik Buterin and Toni Wahrstaetter, aims to impose a hard cap on the maximum gas a transaction can consume in a move developers say could strengthen network stability and make the chain more viable for certain applications. The proposal, EIP-7983, suggests limiting individual transactions to 16,777,216 gas (2\u00b2\u2074) \u2014 a sharp change from the current design which technically allows a single transaction to consume the entire block gas limit. As of Monday, a single Ethereum transaction can consume as much gas as an entire block allows \u2014 a design choice that introduces several performance and security challenges. When a single transaction consumes nearly all the available gas, it disrupts the distribution of workloads across the network and tends to make block execution less efficient. Developers working on zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVM) have found it difficult to process large transactions in parallel, often defaulting to splitting work across multiple transactions instead. And for parallel execution engines, wildly varying gas sizes introduce imbalance across processing threads Proponents say that the cap would simplify these pain points. \u201c16,777,216 is nice because it makes it easier to subdivide things, potentially simplifying downstream engineering,\u201d one contributor wrote in the GitHub thread. Others argued it aligned with Ethereum\u2019s longer-term shift toward modularity and provability. The new ceiling would require splitting some large transactions, such as contract deployments, into smaller chunks. Authors of the proposal stated that most real-world activities already fall well below the limit, and edge cases are minimal. EIP-7983 builds on earlier resource-bounding initiatives, such as EIP-7825, and signals a growing consensus that Ethereum\u2019s base layer should enforce tighter execution guarantees as it scales. The proposal remains in draft status and is now open for broader community review. Read more: Ethereum Developer Proposes 6-Second Block Times to Boost Speed, Slash Fees",

    "content": "SharpLink Gaming (SBET), the Nasdaq-listed firm with a crypto treasury strategy centered on ether ETH, on Tuesday said it has become the largest corporate holder of the asset with 280,706 ETH worth roughly $840 million at current prices. The firm raised $413 million via the issuance of over 24 million shares between July 7 and July 11, according to a press release . It purchased a total of 74,656 ETH over the past week at an average price of $2,852 each. Roughly $257 million of that fundraising remained for future ETH acquisitions, the firm said. SBET shares were trading 5% higher in U.S. action on Tuesday even as ETH slipped modestly to $2,990. The stock has risen roughly six-fold since the ETH treasury pivot several weeks ago. With the latest purchase, the firm said it has now surpassed the Ethereum Foundation, the development organization behind the blockchain, to become the largest corporate owner of ETH. Notably, the foundation recently sold 10,000 ETH to SharpLink Gaming in an OTC deal. The Ethereum Foundation holds $665 million in ETH, according to blockchain data by Arkham Intelligence. Sharplink Gaming is one of the public companies that have recently pivoted to a crypto treasury strategy, following the bitcoin-focused BTC playbook of Michael Saylor's Strategy. Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin joined the firm as chairman. The firm uses capital markets to raise funds to acquire ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, while operating validators and staking the tokens to earn a reward. The company said it has earned 415 ETH, roughly $1.2 million at current prices, through staking since its treasury pivot in June. Other U.S.-listed firms such as Tom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Technology (BMNR) and bitcoin miner BIT Digital (BTBT) also turned into an ETH treasury play.

    "content": "BlackRock is looking to add staking to its iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), a move that would allow the fund to earn rewards by validating transactions on the Ethereum network. Nasdaq, which lists the fund, submitted the amended 19b-4 filing on Thursday. The update signals that BlackRock is aiming to go beyond simple ether ( ETH ) exposure and participate in Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake consensus system. If approved, the ETF could stake a portion of its ETH holdings through one or more trusted providers to generate additional yield. Ether staking involves locking up tokens to help secure the network in exchange for regular payouts. Several asset managers, including Franklin Templeton and Grayscale, have also proposed staking features in their Ethereum ETF filings. The SEC delayed its first deadline to make a decision on those proposals. U.S. regulators have yet to definitively decide whether staking services offered through an ETF would qualify as securities activity. But the inclusion of staking in the BlackRock filing reflects growing confidence that staking could eventually be part of crypto ETFs. The SEC is widely expected to greenlight a further wave of spot crypto ETFs this year after approving similar bitcoin and ether products last year. ETHA is currently trading at $25.42 a share and has attracted over $7.2 billion in assets since its launch in June of last year.",

    "content": "SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ: SBET), the largest corporate holder of ether (ETH), is raising its equity sale target from $1 billion to $6 billion, expanding its strategy of buying ETH for treasury reserves. In an updated filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, the Minnesota-based affiliate marketing firm disclosed a prospectus supplement that increases the amount of common stock eligible for sale by $5 billion, on top of the $1 billion previously filed on May 30. \u201cWe are increasing the total amount of Common Stock that may be sold under the Sales Agreement to $6 billion,\u201d the filing read, noting that SharpLink has already sold $721 million under the original prospectus. The firm says it may sell an additional $279 million from the previous authorization, alongside the new $5 billion issuance. The capital raise is part of SharpLink\u2019s aggressive push into ether . The company now holds over 321,000 ETH, worth approximately $1.1 billion at current prices. That number has grown significantly following a $425 million private placement led by Consensys in early June \u2014 a move that also saw Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin join the company as chairman of the board.

    "headline": "Ethereum's ETH Breaks $3,800 Amid Massive Whale Buy, Large Capital Inflow",
    "content": "Ethereum's ether (ETH) rose nearly 6% during the past 24-hour period, rising above $3,800, outperforming the CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader gauge of the digital assets market. The move comes as major financial institutions and treasury companies have started to pour capital into the digital asset, while Wall Street's heavyweights are starting to pay attention to ETH. Most recently, U.S.-listed spot ether ETFs saw record inflows of $2.18 billion over the past week, which was dubbed as \"crypto week\" as major crypto legislation was passed by the regulators. The rally also coincides with some whales moving a massive amount of ETH on-chain over the weekend. According to on-chain analyst EmberCN, over the weekend, one ETH whale seems to have accumulated around $50 million of the token, at an average price of $3,714. Meanwhile, some analysts are expecting ETH prices to surge much higher than current levels. Most recently, Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat, CIO of Fundstrat Capital, and Chairman of Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), cited various analyses and said that the price could reach as high as $15,000. Before hitting the $3,800 levels, ETH traded within a $255.34 range between a session low of $3,534.57 and a high of $3,789.92 in the last 24 hours, representing 7.22% volatility, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data. Key resistance levels formed at $3,760-$3,790, where trading activity consolidated following multiple upward attempts. The model showed that large buying support seems to have emerged around $3,590-$3,610 during early trading hours as transaction volumes surpassed the 24-hour average of 215,432 units. This consistent upward momentum with successive higher lows potentially indicates ongoing institutional capital allocation, positioning ETH for a possible rally beyond current resistance thresholds.

    "headline": "Ethereum Has Already Won\u2014Paul Brody",
    "content": "At the end of this month (July), the Ethereum public blockchain turns 10 years old. An inordinate amount of time in the world of crypto has been spent on discussing whether or not Ethereum will succeed and become the foundation for the next iteration of global commerce and finance. All this speculation is wasted effort. Ethereum has already won. The losers just don't know it yet. You may be tempted to discount my opinion because I'm a notorious ETH \"maxi\" and have been for a little over a decade now. Hear me out anyway. Side note: Yes. Really. Over a decade. Vitalik Buterin got me started on Ethereum and in my prior incarnation as an IBM executive, I showed off IBM's first foray into blockchain technology at CES in January 2015. That's a story for another day, but I've been in this since the beginning. Blockchains are, first and foremost, technology platforms. We talk about them like they are financial systems, but they behave, and they grow, like technology platforms. And if we look at the history of technology platforms, we can see some clear patterns emerging that Ethereum tends to follow. First, it's a winner-take-nearly-all business. IBM has 100% of the mainframe software business. Windows has 90% of desktops. Android covers about 90% of all smartphones. TCP/IP is about 99.9% of all network traffic. This pattern repeats itself because computing platforms have two factors going in favor of a winner-take-all business model. First, zero marginal cost from adding users. Each additional user costs nearly nothing, so networks can add new users for free. Second, network effects mean that more users make networks more valuable and, as a result, it's extremely hard (but not impossible) for laggards to catch up with the leaders. In the early days of platform development, it's often easy for winners to come and go. Network effects aren't big enough matter, and better products can sweep aside prior leaders. We saw this early in the world of PC and mobile devices as early leaders (Apple II, Commodore 64, and later with Nokia and Blackberry smartphones) were swept aside by impressive new platforms. In all those cases, however, the platform \"type\" was itself very new (less than a decade old) and broad adoption was also relatively low (under 10% of the public). With Ethereum's official 10th birthday at hand, we have passed by both of those metrics. By many accounts more than 20% of the U.S. population owns crypto and blockchain platforms are more than a decade old now. There are, from a technological standpoint, better blockchains than Ethereum out there. One of the foundation lessons of global standards is this: the best technology never wins. From video cassettes to DVDs to mobile computing, platforms gain traction when they get \"good enough\" for a certain set of use cases like payments of NFTs. Many of the most successful platforms never really solve all their key issues and they often get shoe-horned into use cases for which they were never really intended. Case in point: the internet itself was never designed for voice and video and has never really fixed issues with quality-of-service management. But it's good enough and we all have it, so that's how we make calls these days. Yeah, but? So, if Ethereum really won, you might be asking, why are there still so many other thriving blockchain ecosystems? I think there are two answers. First, big network and technology leadership wins don't happen instantly. They take years to manifest fully and in the fog of battle, it can be hard to see who is pulling ahead. With Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake and the creation of the L2 ecosystem, it's clear the network has seen off its biggest challengers and is steadily building on an already dominant position. Number two players will come and go, but turning back Ethereum\u2019s dominance now looks nearly impossible. Ethereum had a near-100% share of the smart contract ecosystem for a long time. As other chains came online, Ethereum's share of key measures like the DeFi ecosystem fell significantly, bottoming out at around 50% in 2023. Since then, it has stabilized and started to rise again, fueled by the success of the L2 ecosystem. No other single ecosystem has even a 10% share of the total market. This isn't an unusual pattern. Microsoft Windows became the largest desktop computing platform in 1984 after a fierce fight in a crowded market. At that time, it still faced intense competition from Commodore, Atari, Apple and others. NeXT, Commodore, Atari, and the Apple II continued to be sold well into the 1990s. BlackBerry sales actually kept rising for the first two years the iPhone was available. Only the Mac survived the long-term PC competition. In the mainframe business, the exit path was even longer. IBM came to dominate the mainframe business after the release of the System/360 in 1964. Unisys, IBM's last global competitor created by the merger of Burroughs and Sperry (of Univac fame), manufactured their last proprietary hardware mainframe in 2015. Secondly, the structure of the blockchain ecosystem itself will further extend the \"shelf-life\" of those networks that failed to gain traction. Most of these are run by foundations, not corporations. As such, there are no shareholders who can demand a return on their capital. Consequently, there's no real exit pressure on chains that haven't succeeded. Expect them to keep on releasing minor updates and mountains of Ethereum-related-concerns on X for the foreseeable future. If there is one final lesson we should take from the world of technology standards, it is this: once locked in place, it is astonishingly difficult and exceedingly rare for the leaders to lose their top spot. Windows has been the winner on the desktop since 1984. IBM has won the data center since 1964. I'm willing to bet that Ethereum will still be the world's preeminent blockchain ecosystem in 50 years.

    "headline": "Privacy Is Key to the Next Phase of Ethereum",
    "content": "Ethereum introduced smart contracts to the world and spurred a Cambrian Explosion of innovation, including DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and a universe of dApps. On July 30, the network will hit its 10 year anniversary. The past decade of the ecosystem focused on proving Ethereum\u2019s functionality and capabilities as well as enhancing efficiency through upgrades like The Merge , which marked the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. The next era requires a pivot to match the more mature ecosystem that it now supports \u2014 one that includes not just Web3 natives but financial institutions, governments, corporations, and people who don't know what \"yield farming\" is but who may want to get a loan for their house with crypto collateral. Amid increasing government and institutional involvement, the hope that crypto will contribute to creating a \"free and open society,\" an ideal originally expressed in A Cypherpunk's Manifesto, is sometimes lost . For Ethereum to make good on that original promise, privacy must be a core tenet of its future. Privacy is identity Some degree of privacy is essential for financial safety and freedom. You wouldn't want to reveal your net worth to the cashier every time you buy a latte or a slice of pizza, but this is essentially how crypto has been operating for the past decade \u2014 with the radical transparency of immutable ledgers recording every transaction publicly. Not only does this level of transparency put individuals at risk for phishing and other attacks , but it also hinders the involvement of institutions that do not want to give their competitors an edge by revealing their activity. Though it is possible to retain pseudonymity through never interacting with a centralized platform, this is not practical for interactions that touch the real world. People and businesses need to be able to interact with governments and banks through ID-linked accounts, and the key to enabling these types of interactions \u2014 without putting personal information in jeopardy to theft and misuse \u2014 is programmable privacy. The solution is ZKP-powered technology The solution is already here: Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-powered smart contracts give users control over what information to share and with whom. With the programmable privacy enabled by ZKPs integrated into Ethereum at a foundational level, a world of applications are not just feasible but practical. Products and services must comply with the regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction in which they operate. This includes collecting customer information in accordance with KYC guidelines, Countering-the-Financing-of-Terrorism (CFT) and AML laws. Typical KYC processes involve sharing some form of ID, such as a passport or driver's license, along with personally identifying information (PII) like name, date of birth and address. If captured by bad actors, this type of information can be used to target people in phishing scams and other types of attacks (see recent Coinbase data breach ). Rather than requiring people to reveal their PII and make themselves and their data vulnerable to attack and theft, ZKP-powered solutions allow people to prove they are not operating out of sanctioned countries and to prove eligibility to participate, all without giving the platform their data and contributing to potential honey pots. The possibilities enabled by ZKPs go well beyond compliance too. Airdrops currently suffer from Sybil attacks where AI bots beat out real human participants to give certain participants an outsized advantage. The same issue applies to decentralized governance. Decision making in a DAO cannot be truly fair and free unless it can be proven that the right number of votes are going to the right number of people \u2014 not bots. ZKPs offer a solution with \"proof of humanity\" via data provenance tools like zkPassport, zkEmail, and zkTLS. Digital payments must provide the same privacy as cash. Payments in dollars, euros, and other sovereign currencies via stablecoins are another important factor in enabling mass adoption of DeFi applications, but this will never take off en masse without privacy guarantees. The same applies to decentralized mortgages, loans, and essentially any type of legal contract, which all require IDs to execute. There are many other applications made possible with privacy as a core tenant of the Ethereum ecosystem. These include proving the authenticity of product or restaurant reviews, enabling secure digital voting, decentralized escrow services, carbon offsetting tracking, proving builder status on GitHub anonymously, and employment skill verification \u2014 all done in a secure, privacy-preserving way that doesn't involve the sharing of sensitive PII to centralized providers. Creating a culture that demands privacy Though the technology exists to implement ZKP solutions today, challenges will need to be overcome before privacy is comprehensively reflected as a core value throughout the Ethereum ecosystem. Technical challenges with implementing ZKP-powered tech include the greater expense of ZKP transactions. Building ZKP-focused applications is also more complicated, posing a learning curve for builders. These are all solvable issues. Other challenges are cultural: creating universal buy-in from the spectrum of participants in the value of privacy and coordinating the implementation of solutions across the tech stack, from protocol to wallet. There is also the misguided perception hurdle of privacy's associations with illicit activity. Changing technology is ultimately easier than changing minds, but the core ethos of crypto is, after all, a philosophical one \u2014 a technology that underpins a belief in freedom and the privacy of individuals and entities. If in another 10 years, we look back on another decade of Ethereum and can celebrate its role in enabling greater financial freedom, an emphasis on privacy will be key.",

    "headline": "The Protocol: Ethereum Validator Exit Queue Backs Up",
    "content": "Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap-up of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I'm Margaux Nijkerk, CoinDesk\u2019s Tech & Protocols reporter. In this issue: Ethereum Validator Exit Queue Tops $2B as Stakers Rush to Quit After 160% Rally Jito Launches BAM to Reshape Solana\u2019s Blockspace Economy Ethereum Validators Signal Intention of Upping Gas Limit to 45M Dogecoin Could Soon Verify ZK Proofs Natively, Thanks to DogeOS Push Unknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Network news VALIDATOR EXIT QUEUE ON ETHEREUM BACKS UP: Ethereum\u2019s validator exit queue posted its longest wait time on record, a possible signal stakers are looking to pull funds after a major price rally in ether (ETH). As of Wednesday 09:00 UTC, nearly 625,000 ETH worth about $2.3 billion was in line to exit the network, data from validatorqueue.com shows. That's even larger than the amount waiting during the January 2024 spike, extending withdrawal delays to over 10 days, the data shows. The congestion is due to the dynamics of Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake model, which limits how quickly validators can join or leave the network. Validators are entities that stake tokens to help secure the blockchain in return for a reward. The exodus is likely due to profit-taking by those who staked ETH when the price was much lower and are now cashing out after it's rallied 160% from an early April trough. \"When prices go up, people unstake and sell to lock in profits,\" said Andy Cronk, co-founder of staking service provider Figment. \"We've seen this pattern for retail and institutional levels through many cycles.\" Unstaking spikes can also occur when large institutions move custodians or change their wallet tech, he said. \u2014 Krisztian Sandor Read more . JITO LAUNCHES BLOCK ASSEMBLY MARKETPLACE : The Jito Foundation introduced the Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM), a system aimed at improving how blocks are built and transactions sequenced on the Solana blockchain. BAM is designed to make \u201ctransaction sequencing transparent and verifiable,\u201d while enabling programmable innovation at the blockspace layer, unlocking new revenue opportunities for developers and reducing the harmful effects of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). The launch builds on Jito\u2019s established infrastructure, including its widely adopted validator client, and the Jito Block Engine. BAM introduces a modular architecture with three key components. BAM Nodes are specialized schedulers that privately organize transactions using secure hardware. BAM Validators run the updated Jito-Solana software client and receive the ordered transactions from the nodes and execute them on-chain. Finally, Plugins will offer developers, traders and applications a programmable interface to interact with the scheduler, enabling customized transaction logic. According to the team, BAM will start up on mainnet in the coming weeks with an initial set of validators led by key Solana ecosystem participants such as Figment, Helius, SOL Strategies and Triton One. \u2014 Margaux Nijkerk Read more . ETHEREUM VALIDATORS BEGIN TO UP THE GAS LIMIT: According to the dashboard gaslimit.pics , as of July 21, 49% of validators' staked ETH indicate that they are in favor of increasing the gas limit to reach 45 million units. On Ethereum, gas is the unit that measures the computational work required to execute transactions or smart contracts. Whenever a user interacts with the blockchain, they must pay a gas fee, which covers the cost of using Ethereum\u2019s computing resources. This ensures users pay in proportion to the complexity of their actions. Each block on Ethereum has a gas limit, which is the maximum amount of gas that can be consumed by all transactions in that block. If the total gas needed by pending transactions exceeds the block\u2019s limit, some transactions are postponed to future blocks. Because space is limited, transactions compete for inclusion, and those offering higher fees are more likely to be included first. The gas limit was last raised in February, when it was set to 36 million. That was the first time since 2021 that it had been increased, after more than half of the validators on the network supported the change, without needing a hard fork. \u2014 Margaux Nijkerk Read more . ZK PROOFS ON DOGECOIN? : Dogecoin might\u2019ve started as a joke, but this upgrade isn\u2019t one. DogeOS, the app layer developed by the MyDoge wallet team, submitted a formal proposal to Dogecoin Core introducing a new opcode to enable the network to verify zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) natively. Developers aim to transform an unused part of the script system into a tool that can verify cryptographic proofs, starting with \u2018Groth16\u2019 (a specific type of proof widely used in ZK systems) and allowing for future upgrades. This would enable Dogecoin to support more advanced, off-chain applications, such as rollups and smart contracts, while maintaining the main chain's speed and simplicity. The approach is modular by design because proof systems are mode-selectable, and the opcode behavior is strictly opt-in. If the proof verifies, the script proceeds; if not, it fails. Old nodes remain compatible, treating the opcode as a no-op. No surprise forks, no VM bloat. \u2014 Shaurya Malwa Read more . Unknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option In Other News Polymarket, the cryptocurrency-powered prediction market that recently attained a billion-dollar valuation , is deciding whether to introduce its own customized stablecoin or accept a revenue- sharing deal with Circle based on the amount of USDC held on the platform, according to a person familiar with the plans. Polymarket\u2019s motivation to create its own stablecoin is simply to own the yield-generating reserves that back the large amount of Circle\u2019s USDC dollar-pegged token used to make bets on the popular betting platform, the person said. A Polymarket representative said no decision has been made. \u2014 Ian Allison Read more. SharpLink Gaming (SBET), the ether (ETH) treasury company led by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, continued its buying spree, bringing total holdings above $1.3 billion.

With the latest acquisition, the firm held 360,807 ETH as of July 20, worth roughly $1.33 billion at current prices.

Before a crowd of crypto executives in the East Room of the White House, a jubilant Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which registered a massive 308-122 bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives on Thursday and an earlier 68-30 vote in the Senate \u2014 demonstrating a huge margin of support from Democrats.Trump walked into the packed room to be met by applauding lawmakers and industry leaders, including Coinbase's Brian Armstrong, Tether's Paolo Ardoino, Circle's Jeremy Allaire, Gemini's Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Kraken's Dave Ripley, Chainlink's Sergey Nazarov and others. \u2014 Jesse Hamilton & Nikilesh De Read more .

    "headline": "Why 'Expensive' Ethereum Will Dominate Institutional DeFi",
    "content": "With over 100 layer-2 (L2) blockchains, you\u2019re excused for thinking Ethereum is too expensive and too slow. But ask any institution preparing to settle a $500 million interest rate swap where they'll build, and the answer is Ethereum. The reason reveals everything about how institutional DeFi is likely to develop. The metrics that matter for institutional adoption are entirely different to retail. While retail users flee Ethereum's transaction fees for cheaper chains, institutions will gladly pay that premium for security when moving hundreds of millions. The premium that people are willing to pay for a safe infrastructure is not an issue. Ethereum's \u201cweaknesses\u201d are actually its institutional moat. A tale of two markets Examining the numbers, the difference in perspective between retail and institutional investors makes sense. If you are buying a memecoin for $50, you don\u2019t want to pay $10 in transaction fees. But when it comes to settling a $500 million interest rate swap, shelling out $10 to ensure a secure transaction is a small price for that peace of mind. One needs to look no further than TradFi to see this perspective is not new, and the security premium to transact on Ethereum is actually the product. There\u2019s a reason why institutions pay more to trade on the NYSE than the Pink Sheets (securities on OTC exchanges), and why they continue to transact through SWIFT, despite its costs. It\u2019s all about legitimacy and a proven track record of conducting transactions in a secure and compliant manner. The same will apply to blockchains. The idea of having hundreds of millions of dollars in funds stuck on an inoperable network is the definition of a nightmare for institutions. Many institutions value the battle-tested security of chains like Ethereum rather than ones that focus on speed. If you take one thing away from this op-ed, understand that traditional finance always pays for infrastructure reliability. Preparing for regulations What investors need most is a robust, market tested base-layer blockchain that is widely accepted among financial institutions as a neutral settlement layer. Ethereum gets serious institutional engagement because the network is properly integrated with existing infrastructure. It\u2019s what it was built for. One proof point is the number of major banks building on Ethereum, who get regulatory comfort with Ethereum's decentralization, as well as from the pool of developer talent that has been, and will continue to be, concentrated within the Ethereum ecosystem. This just might be a self-reinforcing cycle of institutional adoption. A feature, not a failure We need to stop seeing Ethereum's high fees as a failure \u2013 they're a feature that naturally segments the market. Some chains are intentionally optimized for low cost, fast, micro transactions. Institutions need, and will pay for, the digital equivalent of Fort Knox for large ones, where liquidity is available. Instead of looking at metrics like daily active users or translation counts, institutions are taking a more fundamental approach. They are watching where regulated entities are building their infrastructure, and are focused on the big game of institutional settlement. So the next time someone declares Ethereum dead, ask them where they would rather settle a $500 million transaction? The answer reveals why reports of Ethereum's demise are greatly exaggerated \u2013 and why institutions betting on \u201cboring\u201d Ethereum infrastructure will capture the real value in DeFi's institutional future.

    "headline": "Ethereum ETFs Pull In $8.7B in First Year After Almost $5B Rush in Past Two Weeks",
    "content": "The first wave of U.S.-listed spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has racked up nearly $8.7 million in net inflows in its first year on the market, according to public data compiled since the funds launched on July 23, 2024, despite heavy outflows out of Grayscale's Ethereum Trust (ETHE). That performance, while modest compared to their bitcoin counterparts, arrives alongside a surge in investor activity and price momentum. Over the past two weeks alone, the ETFs brought in more than $4.6 billion \u2014 nearly half of their total annual inflows \u2014 coinciding with a sharp uptick in ether\u2019s ( ETH ) price. ETH gained 26% during the week of July 14, after rising 16% the week before, outpacing much of the broader market. It is now trading at $3,704, up 11% on the year. BlackRock\u2019s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) stood out among the pack by crossing $10 billion in assets under management this week. The milestone makes ETHA the third-fastest ETF in history to reach that figure, according to Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Eric Balchunas . Only BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) got there faster. The spot Ethereum ETFs debuted just months after the blockbuster launch of spot bitcoin (BTC) funds, which attracted billions of dollars and renewed Wall Street\u2019s interest in crypto-based products. The Ethereum lineup includes offerings from financial giants like Fidelity, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, and others. The funds have now posted 15 straight days of net inflows, fueled by growing investor appetite and hopes for clearer crypto regulations in the U.S. The SEC has recently signaled openness to crypto legislation and industry engagement, prompting traders to rotate back into digital assets.",

    "headline": "Ethereum Turns 10 \u2014 Time to Leave the Trilemma Behind",
    "content": "Decentralized systems like the electric grid and the World Wide Web scaled by solving communication bottlenecks. Blockchains, a triumph of decentralized design, should follow the same pattern, but early technical constraints caused many to equate decentralization with inefficiency and sluggish performance. As Ethereum turns 10 this July, it\u2019s evolved from a developer playground into the backbone of onchain finance. As institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton launch tokenized funds, and banks roll out stablecoins, the question now is whether it can scale to meet global demand\u2014where heavy workloads and millisecond-level response times matter. For all this evolution, one assumption still lingers: that blockchains must trade off between decentralization, scalability, and security. This \u201cblockchain trilemma\u201d has shaped protocol design since Ethereum\u2019s genesis block. The trilemma isn\u2019t a law of physics; it\u2019s a design problem we\u2019re finally learning how to solve. Lay of the Land on Scalable Blockchains Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin identified three properties for blockchain performance: decentralization (many autonomous nodes), security (resilience to malicious acts), and scalability (transaction speed). He introduced the \u201cBlockchain Trilemma,\u201d suggesting that enhancing two typically weakens the third, especially scalability. This framing shaped Ethereum\u2019s path: the ecosystem prioritized decentralization and security, building for robustness and fault tolerance across thousands of nodes. But performance has lagged, with delays in block propagation, consensus, and finality. To maintain decentralization while scaling, some protocols on Ethereum reduce validator participation or shard network responsibilities ; Optimistic Rollups, shift execution off-chain and rely on fraud proofs to maintain integrity; Layer-2 designs aim to compress thousands of transactions into a single one committed to the main chain, offloading scalability pressure but introducing dependencies on trusted nodes. Security remains paramount, as financial stakes rise. Failures stem from downtime, collusion, or message propagation errors, causing consensus to halt or double-spend. Yet most scaling relies on best-effort performance rather than protocol-level guarantees. Validators are incentivized to boost computing power or rely on fast networks, but lack guarantees that transactions will complete. This raises important questions for Ethereum and the industry: Can we be confident that every transaction will finalize under load? Are probabilistic approaches enough to support global-scale applications? As Ethereum enters its second decade, answering these questions will be crucial for developers, institutions and billions of end users relying on blockchains to deliver. Decentralization as a Strength, Not a Limitation Decentralization was never the cause of sluggish UX on Ethereum, network coordination was. With the right engineering, decentralization becomes a performance advantage and a catalyst to scale. It feels intuitive that a centralized command center would outperform a fully distributed one. How could it not be better to have an omniscient controller overseeing the network? This is precisely where we would like to demystify assumptions. Read more: Martin Burgherr - Why 'Expensive' Ethereum Will Dominate Institutional DeFi This belief started decades ago in Professor Medard's lab at MIT , to make decentralized communication systems provably optimal. Today, with Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC), that vision is finally implementable at scale. Let\u2019s get technical. To address scalability, we must first understand where latency occurs: in blockchain systems, each node must observe the same operations in the same order to observe the same sequence of state changes starting from the initial state. This requires consensus\u2014a process where all nodes agree on a single proposed value. Blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, use leader-based consensus with predetermined time slots in which nodes must come to agreement, let's call it let\u2019s call it \u201cD\u201d. Pick D too large and finality slows down; pick it too small and consensus fails; this creates a persistent tradeoff in performance. In Ethereum\u2019s consensus algorithm each node attempts to communicate its local value to the others, through a series of message exchanges via Gossip propagation. But due to network perturbations, such as congestion, bottlenecks, buffer overflow; some messages may be lost or delayed and some may be duplicated. Such incidents increase the time for information propagation and hence, reaching consensus inevitably results in large D slots, especially in larger networks. To scale, many blockchains limit decentralization. These blockchains require attestation from a certain threshold of participants, such as two-thirds of the stakes, for each consensus round. To achieve scalability, we need to improve the efficiency of message dissemination. With Random Network Linear Coding (RLNC), we aim to enhance the scalability of the protocol, directly addressing the constraints imposed by current implementations. Decentralize to Scale: The Power of RLNC Random Linear Network Coding ( RLNC ) is different from traditional network codes. It is stateless, algebraic, and entirely decentralized. Instead of trying to micromanage traffic, every node mixes coded messages independently; yet achieves optimal results, as if a central controller were orchestrating the network. It has been proven mathematically that no centralized scheduler would outperform this method. That\u2019s not common in system design, and it is what makes this approach so powerful. Instead of relaying raw messages, RLNC-enabled nodes divide and transmit message data into coded elements using algebraic equations over finite fields. RLNC allows nodes to recover the original message using only a subset of these coded pieces; there\u2019s no need for every message to arrive. It also avoids duplication by letting each node mix what it receives into new, unique linear combinations on the fly. This makes every exchange more informative and resilient to network delays or losses. With Ethereum validators now testing RLNC through OptimumP2P \u2014 including Kiln, P2P.org, and Everstake \u2014 this shift is no longer hypothetical. It\u2019s already in motion. Up next, RLNC-powered architectures and pub-sub protocols will plug into other existing blockchains helping them scale with higher throughput and lower latency. A Call for a New Industry Benchmark If Ethereum is to serve as the foundation of global finance in its second decade, it must move beyond outdated assumptions. Its future won\u2019t be defined by tradeoffs, but by provable performance. The trilemma isn\u2019t a law of nature, it\u2019s a limitation of old design, one that we now have the power to overcome. To meet the demands of real-world adoption, we need systems designed with scalability as a first-class principle, backed by provable performance guarantees, not tradeoffs. RLNC offers a path forward. With mathematically grounded throughput guarantees in decentralized environments, it\u2019s a promising foundation for a more performant, responsive Ethereum.

    "headline": "SEC Approves In-Kind Redemptions for All Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs",
    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the use of in-kind creation and redemption processes for all spot bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a significant shift in the regulator\u2019s approach to digital assets under its new leadership. The decision allows authorized participants\u2014large institutional investors who facilitate ETF liquidity\u2014to create and redeem ETF shares directly in BTC or ETH, rather than having to use cash. The mechanism is widely seen as more efficient and secure as it lets authorized participants to closely track investor demand and adjust ETF share supply in real time, without the need to convert assets back and forth into fiat currency. This marks the SEC\u2019s first major crypto-friendly policy move since Paul Atkins was named chair of the agency earlier this year. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner known for his market-friendly views, has long advocated for a more open regulatory approach toward digital assets. \"\u201cIt\u2019s a new day at the SEC,\" said Atkins in a press release. \"A key priority of my chairmanship is developing a fit-for-purpose regulatory framework for crypto asset markets,\u201d he continued. \"I am pleased the Commission approved these orders permitting in-kind creations and redemptions for a host of crypto asset ETPs. Investors will benefit from these approvals, as they will make these products less costly and more efficient.\" The shift comes after BlackRock filed a request in January to allow in-kind transactions for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), and other issuers, including Fidelity and Ark Invest, quickly followed. Until now, all approved spot bitcoin ETFs\u2014first greenlit by the SEC in January 2024 \u2014were only allowed to operate with cash creations and redemptions. That requirement added operational complexity and was widely viewed as a barrier to efficiency for institutional market makers. The SEC also approved an increase in position limits for options trading on IBIT, a move that will allow traders to hold larger options positions tied to the fund. Position limits are regulatory caps that restrict the number of options contracts a trader or institution can control in a single security to prevent market manipulation or excessive risk. By raising these limits, the SEC is signaling greater comfort with the liquidity and maturity of the Bitcoin ETF market, and giving institutional investors more flexibility to hedge or express views on the fund\u2019s performance. The changes could significantly increase institutional participation in both ETF groups by reducing friction for arbitrage and hedging strategies. The SEC\u2019s decision underscores a growing willingness under Atkins\u2019 leadership to treat crypto assets within the same regulatory frameworks applied to traditional markets.",

    "headline": "Ethereum at 10: What's Next for the World Computer?",
    "content": "When Ethereum launched on July 30, 2015, it set out to be more than just another cryptocurrency. It aimed to expand the boundaries of blockchain technology itself. While Bitcoin became digital gold, Ethereum pursued a more expansive vision: to be a decentralized \u201cWorld Computer\u201d\u2014programmable, extensible, and open-ended. A decade later, Ethereum has transformed finance, culture and software. Along the way, it has faced existential crises, volatile markets and fierce internal debates. Now, it stands on the cusp of a new era\u2014one that may see it fully embraced by traditional finance. Ethereum has seen an uptick in the last two months as the project hits the 10 year milestone, with its ETH\u2019s price rebounded, reaching $3,800 in July , after it languished around $1500 just in April. Over the last few months, the ecosystem has seen a new wave of use cases including tokenization and stablecoin growth, and the network also benefited from the trend of companies holding ETH in their treasuries, not just for long-term value, but to earn yield. The Whitepaper That Started It All Ethereum was born from a whitepaper penned by then-19-year-old Vitalik Buterin in 2014, a Canadian college dropout and passionate Bitcoin enthusiast who, inspired by the limitations he saw in Bitcoin, envisioned a more versatile blockchain platform. The network went live a year later, backed by the newly formed Ethereum Foundation (EF), which was tasked with supporting development and spreading Ethereum\u2019s mission. But Ethereum\u2019s honeymoon phase didn\u2019t last. In 2016, the now-infamous DAO Hack nearly broke the network apart when a smart contract vulnerability allowed an attacker to siphon off over 3.6 million ETH, about $13.5 billion at today\u2019s prices. To undo the damage, Ethereum executed a controversial hard fork, effectively creating a new version blockchain. At the time, many saw that the decision to splinter it off broke with the foundational blockchain principle that transactions are immutable and the system is permissionless, raising concerns that human intervention could undermine trust in the protocol's neutrality. After the split, the original chain continued on as Ethereum Classic. \u201cWe showed that we made the right decision, instead of letting the attacker keep all of that ether back then, and that would have been a burden on us this entire time, with trying to get adoption and [focus on building] different things,\u201d said Hudson Jameson, the former Protocol Community Lead at the Ethereum Foundation, in an interview with CoinDesk. The ICO Boom and the Road to the Merge Following the DAO episode, Ethereum entered a period of explosive growth. The 2017 ICO boom saw startups raise billions using ERC-20 tokens. DeFi protocols like MakerDAO, Compound, and Uniswap emerged, enabling permissionless lending, borrowing and trading. But Ethereum\u2019s success exposed its weaknesses. Network congestion and high gas fees revealed a dire need for scalability. Developers began work on Ethereum\u2019s most ambitious upgrade: transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in what would become known as the Merge. The effort, which began in 2017, culminated on September 15, 2022. The transition reduced Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption by over 90% and opened the door to staking. At the same time, layer-2 rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync began to take shape. These networks offered faster, cheaper transactions while leveraging Ethereum\u2019s security. \u201cThe moment when we realized that layer-2s were really taking off and we started to see L2 transaction volumes equal or exceed those of the mainnet and at much, much lower costs,\u201d was a turning point, said Paul Brody, global blockchain leader at EY. Today, layer-2 solutions are bringing in major players. Robinhood announced it will build its own rollup using Arbitrum tech, while Deutsche Bank plans to leverage ZKync for its blockchain initiatives. A Crisis at the Ethereum Foundation? After a grueling bear market in 2022\u20132023, crypto began to recover. Bitcoin surged past $100,000 . Solana, offering quicker transactions and lower fees, emerged as a viable competitor, attracting more new developers to its ecosystem than Ethereum , as well as capital and hype. Meanwhile, ether lagged, dropping to a four-year low against bitcoin in December 2024 , prompting concerns among some in the community about Ethereum\u2019s future, and whether the EF was doing enough to steer the development in the right direction. As things started to bubble up into a crisis, core figures at the Foundation started to ask about where the ecosystem was heading. \u201cHow do we ensure that it's the best thing by many standards? How does it win? How does it be the thing that is adopted,\u201d said Danny Ryan, former Ethereum Foundation core developer and Merge architect. Ryan now co-leads Etherealize, which helps institutions integrate with Ethereum. In February 2025, in response to mounting criticism, the EF restructured its leadership , appointing two new co-executive directors to steer the ecosystem into a new phase, with efforts to be more transparent in its communication and priorities, including being more proactive in the community. Despite its influence, the EF has long resisted becoming the definitive authority on Ethereum\u2019s future. \u201cSo the Foundation definitely never wanted to be a critical player, but wanted to do a lot of good for Ethereum,\u201d said Tomasz Sta\u0144czak, one of the new co-executive directors, in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201cThe Foundation still wants not to be central, but the times are that everyone can be a bit louder. So it's totally fine for Foundation to be as visible as possible, as impactful as possible, because it knows that others can play the same thing,\u201d Sta\u0144czak added. The Foundation remains focused on catalyzing progress, whether that\u2019s scaling Ethereum or supporting institutional adoption. \u201cThis is exactly when we are needed to coordinate quicker,\u201d said Sta\u0144czak. \u201cSo now is the time to make sure that we provide those Ethereum values and make an impact through the institutional integrations. The Foundation should have a focus on it now [meaning institutional onboarding], when it's needed,\u201d Sta\u0144czak added. Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Momentum One of the biggest catalysts for Ethereum\u2019s recent momentum came with the approval of spot ETH ETFs in July 2024 . Managed by legacy financial giants like BlackRock or Fidelity, the spot-ETFs, which now there are nine of in the U.S., marked a watershed moment, opened up access for investors to buy into ETH without having to own the underlying asset. But getting there was not easy. Under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, many in the industry believed that the regulatory hostility stifled crypto innovation. The landscape shifted dramatically after the 2024 U.S. elections, which ushered in a more crypto-friendly Congress and administration. Since then, with the passage of the GENIUS Act (and prior to it), stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets have flooded Ethereum, cementing its place at the heart of institutional crypto adoption. \u201cNow, with a much healthier regulatory environment in the United States, companies can get serious about this stuff, and builders can get serious about this stuff without worrying about a love note from chair Gensler,\u201d said Joseph Lubin, CEO of Consensys and an Ethereum co-founder. \u201cSo the applications and the users and the transactions will come.\u201d More recently, a new trend has emerged with companies focusing on treasury strategies that includes buying up ETH, to not just hold the asset, but for staking and to generate yield. The shift signals that some are looking to leverage Ethereum\u2019s staking system to earn rewards and integrate with a wider DeFi ecosystem. SharpLink Gaming (SBET), the Nasdaq-listed crypto treasury firm helmed by Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin, has emerged as one of the leading firms in this field. \u201cI think DeFi is going to be the first major use case, and you can call it real world assets and stablecoins and lending, borrowing, etc. DeFi will be the first real use case that enterprises and financial institutions adopt,\u201d Lubin said. \u201cIf you pay attention to what's going on with these ether treasury companies like, like our own, SBET, it's clear that Wall Street is paying attention.\u201d What\u2019s Next for Ethereum? Ethereum now stands at an inflection point, as some of the world\u2019s biggest financial institutions come into crypto through Ethereum\u2019s rails. \u201cFive years ago, a lot of these banks and financial institutions understood, or were beginning to understand the value of a digitally native, programmable environment,\u201d said Ryan of Etherealize. \u201cAlthough there were people that kind of understood the value of public blockchains in banks, still a little more than a year ago now, they were like \u2018we get it, but we can't touch it,\u2019 given the regulatory uncertainty.\u201d With institutions now onboard, the next year will likely define its long-term relevance. Developers are focusing on both user experience and scalability, not only via layer-2 expansion but also through improvements to the base layer itself. \u201cWe've solved most of our problems, doesn't mean we have the final state. There's still tons of improvements, and we need so much more scalability,\u201d said Lubin. Beyond the technical, Ethereum\u2019s stewards are also contemplating its role in a rapidly changing world. \u201cWhen we think about the next 10 years of Ethereum, I think the questions we [the EF] are asking [are] \u2018what are the biggest fears of centralization for humanity, globally nowadays, and mostly it's AI,\u2019\u201d said Sta\u0144czak at the EF. \u201cNow is the time to spark with people some excitement with being meaningful and having big, moonshot projects around something that is really, really important for the next 10 years.\u201d The interviews in this piece have been edited for brevity and clarity.

    "content": "Yesterday, July 30th, was the 10-year anniversary of Ethereum\u2019s launch. In today\u2019s Crypto for Advisors newsletter, Alec Beckman from Psalion writes about Ether\u2019s growing role as a treasury reserve asset and highlights growing trends. Then, Eric Tomaszewski from Verde Capital Management answers questions about Ether as an investment in Ask an Expert. Thank you to our sponsor of this week's newsletter, Grayscale. For financial advisors: register for the upcoming Minneapolis event on September 18th. - Sarah Morton Unknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Ethereum: The Rising Treasury Asset Reshaping Corporate Finance Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is rapidly being adopted by public companies as a strategic treasury asset, an evolution that is helping to reshape corporate finance and shift ETH\u2019s market dynamics. Bitcoin has long dominated the digital treasury conversation . Its capped supply and decentralized nature make it a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Ether is catching up, thanks to its yield potential, economics, real-world utility, and maturing institutional infrastructure. Why Ethereum Appeals to Treasuries Ethereum\u2019s 2022 transition to proof-of-stake enabled holders to earn annual staking yields between 2% and 4%, creating a passive income layer that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t offer. The asset has also been deflationary at times, with more ETH burned than issued, supporting a store-of-value thesis. At the same time, Ethereum powers an ecosystem of decentralized applications, tokenized assets, and smart contracts. For corporations, it can function not only as a reserve asset but also as capital for deploying services and infrastructure. The ETH Treasury Wave Several public companies are now building treasury strategies around ETH, following early movers like MicroStrategy in Bitcoin: Bit Digital holds over 120,300 ETH and stakes its entire allocation. CEO Sam Tabar calls it a \u201cflywheel model,\u201d where staking yield funds operations. They plan to add more to the tune of > $1b. BTCS recently increased its holdings to over 70,000 ETH and was among the first public firms to stake ETH as a treasury strategy. Bitmine Immersion is aiming to acquire 5% of total ETH supply . Backed by significant funding and led by Tom Lee, it now holds over 625,000 ETH. Sharplink Gaming holds more than $1.67 billion in ETH, adding nearly 80,000 coins in a single week and pursuing staking as a core strategy. Joe Lubin is a board member and running their ETH acquisition strategy. Gamesquare has allocated an initial $30 million in ETH with approval to scale to $250 million . It also plans to integrate DeFi and NFT-based yield as differentiators. GameSquare sees the Ethereum Network as Manhattan, with a Financial District (DeFi), an art district (NFTs), and more. Investing in it today is critical for future value and use. The Ether Machine , a SPAC-backed vehicle spun out from Publicly Traded Dynamix, is targeting $1.5 billion in ETH as it prepares to go public. The companies listed above all plan to add significantly more. Other companies have just announced their holdings such as ETHzilla . These companies aren\u2019t just buying\u2026 they\u2019re signaling long-term conviction and, in many cases, building products and revenue streams directly on Ethereum. One example is GameSquare, whose strategy closely aligns with their audience in the gaming, media, and entertainment industries and sees the connection with on-chain products built on Ethereum. It is important to them to foster financial alignment with their audience. BTCS is implementing a similar strategy to align with its audience, as block building and staking create a vertical stack on the Ethereum Network, resulting in efficiencies in transactions and staking. The Demand\u2013Supply Imbalance ETH\u2019s price has climbed steadily in recent months, and public company purchases are one of the primary catalysts for this increase. In a recent 30-day span, over 32 times more ETH was purchased than issued . That includes buying from treasury allocators, staking vehicles, and newly approved ETFs. A continuation of this trend will create a supply shock. Unlike Bitcoin, where miners often must sell their bitcoin to cover operational costs, Ethereum\u2019s shift to proof-of-stake reduces sell-side pressure and aligns holders with securing the network. Conclusion Ethereum is no longer just a platform for developers; it\u2019s now a financial asset that public companies are adopting at scale. With built-in yield, deflationary dynamics, and rising institutional demand, ETH is emerging as a cornerstone of corporate treasury strategy. As more firms move from \u201cinterested\u201d to \u201callocated,\u201d this new wave of ETH buyers may help define the next phase of the crypto cycle. Special thank you to Sam Tabar, CEO of Bit-Digital, Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare and Rhydon Lee, managing partner of Goff Capital (affiliated with GameSquare) on sharing their insights with me on ETH Treasury Companies, differentiation, and the Ethereum network in general. - Alec Beckman, vice president of growth, Psalion Unknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Ask an Expert Q: Why is ETH being discussed as a strategic reserve asset? A: Ethereum has quietly become financial infrastructure, not just a speculative asset. Unlike bitcoin (which is mostly a \u201cstore of value\u201d ), ETH powers a real economy that ties to smart contracts, tokenized assets, stablecoin transactions, and decentralized financial services. As more economic activity settles on Ethereum, ETH is being considered a reserve asset by institutions, fintech firms, DAOs, and even sovereign actors. The reason is that ETH is the fuel that makes the system work. It's similar to holding oil in an energy economy or treasuries in a dollar system. Q: Should corporate treasuries treat ETH like a cash equivalent, long-duration tech-oriented equity, or a form of intangible infrastructure? A: In practice, I see this as a new sleeve in the portfolio that I\u2019d call a \u201cdigital infrastructure reserve.\" It carries tech beta and regulatory risk, but also offers operational utility (smart-contract escrow, settlement, tokenization rails). That\u2019s neither cash nor equity. Q: How do you translate \u201cETH as a strategic reserve\u201d into practical implications? A: For institutions and treasuries: ETH serves as the cash and collateral for running on-chain businesses. It generates yield (staking) like T-bills. It\u2019s held on balance sheets, declared in treasury policies, and audited. For individuals & families: ETH is treated as a long-term strategic asset. Allocated thoughtfully (at least 1 \u2014 5%) and separated from short-term needs. Used to earn staking income, hedge against fiat devaluation, and gain exposure to Ethereum\u2019s growing role in finance and tokenized infrastructure. Q: What would prove that ETH deserves to be treated like a serious reserve asset over the next 10 years? A: If more of the world\u2019s financial activity like tokenized real estate, stablecoins, and large international payments are settling directly on Ethereum, it shows growing trust in the network. As Ethereum becomes core infrastructure for global value transfer, ETH moves from speculation to a legitimate strategic reserve. Strategicethreserve.xyz is a great source for gauging progression. Beyond that, it's helpful to watch the innovation and creativity of names like Robinhood and The Ether Machine, to name a few. - Eric Tomaszewski, financial advisor, Verde Capital Management Unknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Keep Reading The White House released its first Digital Asset Policy Repor t on Wednesday, July 30th.
