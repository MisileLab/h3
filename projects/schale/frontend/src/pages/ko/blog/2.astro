  <h1>The patch</h1>
  <p>The patch starts with this sentence.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Remove some entries due to <strong>various compliance requirements.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Seriously, what is various compliance requirements?</p>
  <p>I think it's not enough explaination really.</p>
  <p>especially, when they just suddenly removed from maintainers, with one patch.</p>

  <h2>The political choice can ruins Linux user</h2>
  <p>Let's assume Russian made a compatibility of some hardwares.</p>
  <p>Then he disappears, with one patch.</p>
  <p>Then who will maintain that? <strong>That hardware user has now several problems because of one patch.</strong></p>

  <h2>Open-source should be not political</h2>
  <p>What if American like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Edward Snowden</a> maintains?</p>
  <p>Then just disappears in maintainers, because of America doesn't like it?</p>
  <p>It's not good definitely, and really.</p>

  <h1>You will says "You're loving Russian goverment"</h1>
  <p>and I'm not.</p>
  <p>I don't like Russian goverment, Putin, and I wants to support Ukraine.</p>
  <p><strong>but</strong>, why Russian needs to be removed because of Russian goverment?</p>
  <p>I mean, look them, They didn't any stupid things, criminal, they just lived in, born in Russia.</p>
  <p>and removed because of that?</p>

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>I likes open-source because so many different types of user can unite on one important thing, Code</p>
  <p>and now, it changed. to worse form.</p>
  <p>I want to say <strong>open-source should be not political.</strong></p>
